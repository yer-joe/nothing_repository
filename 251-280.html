The orientation diagrams of the differ- ent necropolises studied show a certain preference for the sectors of the horizon around the cardinal points East and West (see Fig. 2.b.29). But it is the declination histogram (of 85 tombs, those in which an orientation can be defined without ambiguity, Belmonte et al. 2002) that shows without doubt, that the Garamantes astro- nomically oriented their funerary monuments and, also, with a very clear tendency towards the declination of the sun at the equinoxes, confirming what is established for earlier eras that indicate a certain predilection for the equinox, in a more general lunar-solar framework of patterns.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In conducting the comparative analysis of the proposed property, this equinoctial tendency of the Amazigh peo- ples of north Africa may explain one of the most em- blematic events: the presence of equinoctial markers on the island of Gran Canaria and, in particular, in the area of the Cultural Landscape. As has already been men- tioned, this interest in the equinoxes is just one of the many cultural hallmarks that the first settlers brought with them from the continent to the islands at the time of the colonisation. The origin of this custom in Africa is worth taking into consideration. On the eastern bor- ders of the Sahara, we have the Pharaonic civilisation with the funerary temples of the pyramid ensembles with their clear eastward orientation.Thus, this phenom- enon can be found right across the north of Africa and it is difficult to pinpoint its origin, although the Egyptian pyramids are ancient and their elaborated temples are perhaps the oldest monuments with a precise alignment with the equinoxes (3rd millennium BC).There are ideb- nis in Fadnun that are oriented eastward that may date back to the 5th millennium BC. On the other hand, the ancient Canaanites, the forefathers of the Phoenicians, and the Romans themselves revered the equinox as an</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figura 2.b.30. Stelae, with their corresponding tables for libations, which were situated opposite the funerary monuments of the Garamantes marking a preferred direction.There are some in the form of a betyl, others in a V-shape and others in the form of an open palm hand (the wrongly named “Fátima’s hand”), like those on display in the Archaeological Museum of Germa.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© Juan Antonio Belmonte</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">important seasonal milestone, with the Spring equinox certainly being the marker of the start of the year in an- cient Rome. As it is almost always the case, the answer is not unequivocal and we should perhaps search for a complex solution associated with the desertification of the Sahara, which lead to the dispersion of a series of customs, which must have shared a similar origin, both in terms of space and time that cannot yet be fully un- derstood.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Punic Tradition</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">According to classical sources, at the end of the 11th Century BC, seafarers from Phoenician coasts founded the first colonies − their new homeland in the West</p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">− on the coasts of the Maghreb and the south of the Iberian Peninsula. In this way Utica, Gades and Lixus en- tered history. However, all of these cities were eclipsed by the power of their younger sister, Carthage, founded according to the sources in 814 BC. The Phoenician city was Africanised over time becoming an undisput- able military and commercial power. It kept the emerg- ing Roman Empire in check until its total destruction in 146 BC and had a lasting influence on its neighbouring Amazighs. The civilisation created by Carthage, quite different from its original homeland, is often given the name Punic to distinguish it from its parent culture, the Phoenician one. The main Punic divinities, the god Baal Hammon and the goddess Tanit, despite having equiva- lents in Phoenicia, had some unique attributes associ- ated with their African land of adoption, so that in the Roman period, Saturn and the Dea Caelestis, their suc- cessors, are considered the most important deities of western Africa, independently of the Punic, Mauretanian, Numidian or even Roman origin of its inhabitants.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">On many occasions Baal Hammon has been associated with the Egyptian divinity revered in the Siwa Oasis that may be of Libyan origin or at least borrows attributes from a Libyan divinity, of an apparent solar nature,. This may be the sun god that all the Libyans worshipped. Tanit-Caelestis is sometimes associated with the moon but it is more likely that it was associated with the planet Venus, as a manifestation of the goddess Astarte, with which it was frequently associated. In reality, it is likely that in the northwest of Africa the moon was a mascu- line divinity as was the case in the neighbouring Egypt and would also be the case in the Canarian Archipelago. In any case, given the astral nature of the Punic divinities, it is likely that this fact would manifest in some way in the religious structures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Despite the centuries of Punic rule in the region, there are relatively few remains that have been preserved, as most of the cities were later converted into Roman cities and villages or some, like Carthage, were razed to the ground. Thus, there are very few public buildings that remain from the first millennium before the Com- mon Era. Fortunately, in the western Mediterranean, the Phoenicians chose a method of burial that has stood the test of time.The custom of carving hypogea in the rock may have been imported from the East or may have imitated the local customs encountered in the countries colonised by the Punics (like Sardinia, Sicily or Africa it- self), where this type of funerary structure had been in use since the Neolithic Era, and indeed continued in use in the case of the Canary Islands until the archipelago was colonised by Europe in the Middle Ages.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">As an example of the Punic necropolises with tombs dug out of the rock, one of the most interesting ex- amples has been chosen, with no less than fifty per- fectly preserved hypogea, that of Menzel Temine. This is located in a rocky promontory on the outskirts of this settlement in the region of Cap Bon, one of the richest from an agricultural point of view during the golden age of the Punic civilisation (Figure 2.b.31). It is not known which human settlement was associated with the necropolis and it is highly possible that this is located below the current village. In any case, the place has retained its religious significance as the marabout of an important Muslim saint rises up alongside the ne- cropolis. Some of the hypogea are adorned with paint- ings and carvings, and “signs of Tanit” are common, as on the funerary stelae. Both Tanit and Baal Hammom were psychopomp divinities that were associated with worshipping the dead. If the funerary divinities were as- tral divinities, one would expect the Punic hypogea to present astronomical patterns.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The astronomical declination histogram obtained from the combined data on orientation and inclination of the access steps is very informative (see Figure 2.b.31). The distribution shows two significant peaks both of which have strong astronomical connotations. One is centred on the equinoxes and the other on the declination of the sun at the winter solstice (Belmonte et al. 1998). Curiously, this pattern shows similarities with various patterns found in the Maghreb and the analysis of it could have important implications for intercultural re- lationships.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">In Sardinia, for example, it has been found that the ori-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.31.

Right: Declination histogram of the Punic tombs of the necropolis of Menzel Temine.The distribution shows a clear astronomical pattern with two peaks centred on the declinations of the equinoctial sun and the sun at the winter solstice, respectively.This double pattern is typical of numerous cultures of the Mediterranean region. © Juan Antonio Belmonte</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">entation of the tombs in the Punic necropolises of the island also appear to follow certain patterns, again with the equinox and the winter solstice being the two most important reference points. However, this distribution is also found in other parts of North Africa but not in a Punic context. Besides, the importance of equinoctial orientations in the region is already apparent. Evidence is lacking to affirm whether the pattern found is typically Punic, coming from customs originating in the East and imported by the colonizers, or whether an apparent Af- rican influence can be detected thanks to the mixing of settlers with the original inhabitants in the country of Amazigh origin. The answer is often found in the mid- dle ground. It is possible that similar customs combined, given the astral nature of the main divinities of both people, whereby the Phoenicians would have brought with them a certain inclination towards lunar-solar ori- entation and this would have mixed in the Maghreb with the predilection of the Libyan people for certain key moments in the seasonal cycle, such as the solstices and the equinoxes (or the associated moons).This fruit- ful combination would have resulted in one of the most genuine astronomical orientation customs that has been detected on the western Mediterranean.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Sacred geography and astronomy of the Numidians</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In northwestTunisia, on the borders between the ancient Africa Proconsularis and Numidia, there is an enormous concentration of cities in ruins that is unequalled in any other region of the Roman Empire, except perhaps in Rome itself. Within a radius of 100 kilometres we find large cities like Dugga, former colonies of veterans, like Mustis or Thuburnica, ancient capitals of the Kingdom of Numidia, like Mactar or Bulla Regia and its pretty subter- ranean houses, famous fortified cities in the history of the region, like Sicca Venerea (now Le Kef) or cities that rose up thanks to peculiar economic activities. This is precisely the case of the city of Shimitu (now Chemtou) that owed its existence to the presence of an impres- sive mountain that had one of the richest red marble deposits in the Empire and where quarries were already in use since the Numidian era, exporting the prized ma- terial to the most remote corners of the Mediterranean (Figure 2.b.32).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The place must have been sufficiently important for</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">one of the Kings of Numidia, possibly Micipsa, to erect</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">a formidable edifice on the summit of the mountain to commemorate his predecessor Massinisa and which may also have been his funerary monument. Built on the meridian axis, this consisted of a large rectangular platform crowned with four rows of columns, one on each of its faces (see Figure 2.b.32). The building was profusely adorned with the most diverse motifs includ- ing some of astral typology. In particular, on the lintel of the door, open on the eastern facade of the building, a frieze showed the typical Egyptian representation of the winged sun, flanked by two cobras. In the Roman era, the mausoleum was dedicated to worshipping Saturn, as the numerous rock carvings on the sides of the moun- tain bears witness to. A curious aspect of the building is its orientation, facing eastwards towards a spot on the horizon where a depression between two moun- tains marked the sunrise on the equinoxes.Thus, we find another example of a pattern that is repeated on the funerary monuments of the Maghreb - a tradition that would persist through the golden age of the Kingdom of Numidia. Indeed other mausoleums of its kings like Kbor Klib, near Mactar, or Medracen at the foot of the Aures mountains in Algeria, show similar orientations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The mountain of marble, alongside its practical use as a quarry may have been imbued with a special religious quality since the first settlers arrived in the area. Proof of this is the three archaeological levels that have been found in the forum of the Roman era. The upper level, that of the forum itself, was fully rebuilt in the Roman era to construct the large square in the enclosure. However, excavations have shown at least two archaeological lev- els below this (see Figure 2.b.32).The lower level shows the presence of at least two megalithic monuments with an eastward orientation that are difficult to date but which probably predate the Numidian period. Above these, in the intermediate level, there is a large circular tomb, a stone cylindrical shape, known as bazinas in the Amazigh world, which was possibly a mausoleum of the local elites. What appear to be the remains of a temple have been found on the northern side, presumably of a funerary nature as it is associated with what is clearly a necropolis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Curiously, this temple is oriented to the summit of the mountain on which the large mausoleum was built; a place where the sun rises at the summer solstice. Thus, it would seem that the place where the necropolis was built may have been deliberately chosen so that on the solstice the sun could be observed as it rose over the summit of the mountain on which the great royal mau-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">soleum would later be erected. We thus find a unique case of sacred geography with a sacralised observation backsight and a reference foresight, where a relevant astronomical event occurs, which was also deemed sa- cred. In this case, we also have a building aligned with the equinoxes. The case, although exceptional, is not unique (Esteban et al. 2001).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Another unique example has been found in the city of Mactar, an important urban centre in the Kingdom of Numidia, with a spectacular megalithic necropolis, and later a thriving city in the Roman era. In this case, the equinox marker was comprised of a step in the moun- tains on the eastern horizon, whereby the sun rose over this geographical feature, one day after the spring equinox or one day before the autumn equinox.This al- lowed the corresponding dates to be determined with relative precision. The notch is visible from most of the ruins of the city, but it is particularly conspicuous at the ancient site of the temple of Apollo, the foundations of which still remain, showing that its main axis is clearly aligned to the rising sun on the equinoxes close to the step on the mountain (see Fig.ure 2.b.31). This temple was reconstructed in the 2nd Century on the founda- tions of an early temple erected in honour of Baal Ham- món by one of the kings of Numidia that had founded the city in the 2nd Century BC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Mactar occupied a prominent place in the history of Numidia as it was the city that controlled the southern border of the kingdom and in it Jugurtha sought refuge on various occasions during its long wars against Rome. The city was annexed, together with all of eastern Nu- midia, by Julius Caesar, and it would experience a golden age under the Empire, preserving many of its earlier traditions so that in the 3rd Century the Punic script and the Libyan script were still used for inscriptions on monuments and on funerary stelae. The alignment of the sun god temple with the equinox (Apollo, and Baal Hammón before that) has been repeated in numerous temples in ancient Roman Africa and, in particular, in another two temples of Saturn, that of Simithus, already discussed, and that of Volubilis, in Mauretania Tingitana. In reality, all the temples of Saturn have an eastward orientation and, if we allow a certain margin, all have a lunar-solar orientation (Esteban <span class="s2">et al</span>. 2001; Belmonte <span class="s2">et al. </span>2006). This is an indication, on the one hand, of the clear astral nature of this divinity, and on the other, that this pattern, dominant in the Maghreb, is regularly re- peated in the temples where the pre-Roman influence is more evident.Thus, we can consider the astronomical</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figura 2.b.32.The “mountain of marble” in the archaeological site of Simithu (a).The mausoleum of one of the kings of Numidia was built at its summit. It has an almost perfect alignment with the sunrise at the equinoxes.Three archaeological levels in the Roman forum of Simithu (b). Underneath the plaza, which was razed to the ground in the Roman era, excavations have shown the presence of a megalithic necro- polis and on it, a Numidian funerary monument with its associated temple, aligned with the sun’s rising position at the summer solstice over the royal mausoleum at the summit of the “mountain of marble” (c).The figure is completed with the image of the rising sun at the equinox, following the line of symmetry of the Temple of Sun at Mactar (d).The phenomenon can be observed near a notch on the horizon that could have been used as an equinox marker. Parallels with Gran Canaria are clear.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">orientation of the temples as the last exponent of a tradition that was born in the Neolithic era in the vast extensions of the Sahara and which continued in the Canary Islands until the 15th Century. Interestingly, this tradition was deliberately avoided in the entire Maghreb region during the Islamic period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Persistence through the Roman Era</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">When the Romans conquered the North of Africa from the Gulf of Sirte to Tingitana there was a thriving</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">civilisation there with Amazigh roots and with strong Punic footprint with a highly developed urban nature. One of these examples of urbanism was the city of Sa- bratha in Tripolitania. Founded as a Phoenician colony, it was first under Punic rule and then under the control of Numidia. It was later annexed by Rome, conquered by the Vandals, reconquered by the Byzantines and then abandoned after the arrival of Islam. There are remains here of a splendid mausoleum from the Punic era (or perhaps the Numidian one) and the tophet of the city has offered an infinity of very interesting stelae with the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.33. (a) Orientation diagram of the temples of Sabratha, showing their astronomical connections.The dotted lines show the axes of the forum, corresponding to the grid of the western sector of the city, perhaps oriented with the setting of the star Sirius, the brightest in the sky. Other temples practically face North, East or have other significant astronomical orientations such as an alignment with the sun’s rising position at the summer solstice. (b) Mundus carved into the floor of the Roman forum of the splendid ruins of Sbeitla (formerly Sufetula).This diagram is perfectly adapted to the axes (cardus and decumanus) of the city that may have been oriented to the rising of Sirius when it was built. Another diagram (c), inscribed in the same forum clearly shows the cardinal points.The local capitol, very well preserved, can be seen in the background.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">typical Punic paraphernalia, including the signs of Tanit and the open palm hand. However, most of what can be visited today hails from the Roman and Byzantine era, the authentic swan song of the city in which Justinian or- dered that various churches and a basilica were erected.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The town planning was typically Roman with space or- ganised like a chessboard with one notable exception. The urban planning of Sabratha appears to have taken place in two different stages: an earlier stage which in- cludes the zone of the forum and the western sector of the city and a later one in the theatre district, which covers the eastern district. The theatre district is more or less aligned with the cardinal points, an orientation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">that is determined astronomically (Figure 2.b.33). The forum district is less clear as one of its axes is aligned so that most of the temples in the centre of the city are oriented with a declination around ±17º, depending on whether they face east or west. A very interesting pos- sibility is that this axis is marked by the star Sirius (the Dog Star again), which in the last centuries BC when Sabratha became a city, had a declination within this range. A curious fact about this sector of the city is the presence of two large temples that do not respect the urban grid, something which is particularly evident when looking at the map of the city.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One of these, situated to the south of the forum, was</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">erected on a large platform and it is still not known which divinity it was dedicated to, as excavation of it offered little evidence in this respect. However, its ori- entation towards the rising sun at the summer solstice would lead us to believe that the host of the temple must have been a sun god (perhaps Baal Hammón, the great Carthaginian divinity). There must have been a very good reason for this temple breaking entirely with the urban plan. It is most likely that its outstanding astro- nomical orientation was the reason for this.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">More intriguing still is the fact that Sabratha is not the only case of an orientation involving Sirius. Another case is the spectacular city of Sbeitla in the south of Tuni- sia, the ancient Sufetula, beautifully preserved as it was practically abandoned after playing an important role as an imperial seat of power at the crucial time of the Muslim invasion of Byzantine Africa. Sufetula has a grid planimetry that is typical of the Roman era (Belmonte <span class="s2">et al. </span>2006). However, here, the map has a different fo- cus. In the forum of the city there is a pair of identical carvings in the stony floor of the enclosure (see Figure 2.b.33). Both take the form of circles divided into eight sections that are thought to represent the ancient ‘mun- dus’ of the city that would mark out how this was struc- tured. However, both of them have completely different orientation patterns. One is oriented with the cardinal points, which indicates that the topographers knew the precise position of these directions that were so impor- tant for many purposes. The second, however, precisely follows the directions of the city grid, which is dictated by the north-south oriented cardus, which crosses the forum in a WNW-ESE direction, and the decumanus perpendicular to this.Thus, it can be inferred from these carvings that this planimetry was deliberately selected. According to this pattern, the cardus, either by chance or by design, is oriented to the rising of the brightest star in the sky, again Sirius. Thus, there are at least two examples of orientations with this celestial object of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">crucial significance in the ancient Mediterranean and in the Maghreb and which, in ancient Egypt, played a vital role in the structuring of the calendar and in the orien- tation of the temples (Belmonte, 2012).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">It is also curious that certain temples of Sabratha, and the urban planning of this city and of the nearby Sufet- ula, are astronomically oriented with the rising sun at the summer solstice and with the luminary Sirius, re- spectively.These orientations were also significant in the case of Gran Canaria as markers of the New Year. As it has been mentioned in another section of this memo- ry, a close link has been found between the alphabets used in ancient south-eastern Numidia and its southern borders with the Garamantes’ territory and the alpha- bet used in the Canary Islands. This has allowed the hy- pothesis to be put forward that the Amazigh people that colonised the Archipelago came from the regions of the south of Tunisia or the northwest of Libya, on the borders of the Roman Tripolitania.The astronomical orientations found in this region and other neighbouring areas up to the edges of the Sahara, suggested some- thing that was already conceived, that the astronomical knowledge shown by the indigenous Canary Islanders in general, and by those of Gran Canaria in particular, was born in their African homeland and was imported to the Archipelago when people came and settled here at the turn of the era. However, it is nonetheless the case that once brought to the islands this phenomenology was adapted to local environmental factors. In the case of Gran Canaria and in the area of the sacred moun- tains, this meant adaptation to an outstanding landscape that the ancient people of the Canary Islands adopted as their own and sculpted, hollowed and adapted to their needs, creating a true Cultural Landscape in which the skyscape played a vital role. Risco Caído and Roque Bentayga are paradigmatic examples of this accomplish- ment, but they are not the only ones.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2.b.vii</p><h2 style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The gender dimension</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 35pt;text-align: left;">T</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: right;">he important role that women played in the differ- ent echelons of society is one of the most unique elements of the culture of the indigenous people of Gran Canaria identified in the archaeology of the area to which the proposed property belongs. Although re- search into this area is not abundant, some studies on the position that women held in indigenous society are worthy of special mention.

The role of women in indigenous Gran Canaria may be an impor- tant point of focus in the study of past societies with regard to aspects such as matrilineality in the transfer of power: “<span class="s2">… whose name came from Guanarteme and shortly after the death of the Father and at the will of the female cousin an uncle of the mother’s brother called Gua- narteme Semidán was appointed high-priest of Gáldar</span>” (Morales, 1993: 198)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">In work based on the gender perspective in the study of indigenous history, worthy of special mention is the legend of Atidamana, a woman who united her peo- ple shortly before the conquest: “<span class="s2">In the municipality of Gáldar, in the best part of the island, there was a damsel named Atidamana, who was fair and respected by all and whose words were so powerful that she moved all that</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">heard her. And when met with opposition she was com- posed and brought about peace” <span class="p">(Abreu, 1978: 171).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Many of the testimonies from the chronicles can be viewed in the archaeological records at the sites within the Cultural Landscape. These include testimonies on rituals, burials, manufacturing, agricultural practices, safe- keeping and distribution of surplus produce, the trans- mission of knowledge or important powers relative to political order. The information given in said chronicles, reinterpreted from the perspective of gender, gives us an important insight into the meaning of archaeological manifestations such as pubic carvings, found in this area and of the caves that contained them, as well as some of the areas where they are found, which are clearly sacred in nature, as is the case of the almogaren at Risco Caído and, particularly, the sanctuary at Risco Chapín. These are indeed sacred sites where women played a huge and leading role, as was the case of the harimaguadas or maguadas, who specialised amongst other things in religious affairs: “<span class="s2">Canarian women included many religious women, who lived in seclusion and who lived off what they received from the nobles, with their prominent houses and dwellings... </span>“ (Abreu page 156).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">The groups of people that settled on the Canarian Ar- chipelago before the Conquest are a paradigm in the study of gender, in that they represented a specific case in the development of societies in isolated contexts.The organisation of these societies and their social produc- tion relations are worthy of analysis. It is still early to say whether any of the characteristics associated with women relate to the prehistoric culture or “epigonal stage”, whether they are an endogenous product of that society or contain continuities of the places of ori- gin of these people (African Amazigh societies). In any case, women played a central role in power, as can be seen in one of the texts referring to the surrender of that people: “.<span class="s2">.. and the Canarians left Tirajana with their matriarch. They brought her in procession, seated on the shoulders of four fair-haired nobles… behind the entourage came the two high-priest uncles..</span>” (Morales, 1993: (363- 364).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The gender perspective also helps understand the pro- cess of acculturation and dismantling of the indigenous society and the emergence of the new interbred society in the territory in question.This is evident in the last will and testament of María Téllez , who was a descendent of the indigenous people, in which certain assets con- sidered of a sacred nature in the past (almogarenes) are</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.35. Many of the remnants of the indigenous society have been maintained and passed on by women.This is the case of the ceramics produced using indigenous techniques.

The persecution of women in the Inquisi- tion also evidences this. In the same manner, worthy of special mention are certain threads of indigenous society that still exist in traditional culture.These are es- sentially women’s work, such as handcrafts using plant fibres, herbal lore (medicinal herbs) and, above all, in the area in question, economic activities related to graz- ing livestock and ceramic production using indigenous techniques, which still continues to the present day in Lugarejo, in the core zone of the nominated property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">A re-reading of the past is required in these areas from the perspective of what is at least half of the population. This should be done within the historical context adjust- ing the androcentric parameters on which traditional research has been based, not only in relation to creating interpretative hypotheses, but also in relation to creat- ing strategies in the actual acquisition of data. It is this part of research strategies that has capacity for change in the future in the manner in which historical discourse on the Risco Caido and sacred mountain sites project is presented and interpreted. It is essential to identify the women in this area, recognising their leading role in many of the manifestations and activities that gave rise to the material and intangible heritage that make up much of the attributes of the proposed property.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">260</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">261</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2.b.viii</p><h2 style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Spirituality and popular beliefs</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 35pt;text-align: left;">T</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">he Canary Islands are home to a series of beliefs</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">and customs of a magical nature that define a large part of our cultural heritage. These beliefs are of par- ticular interest concerning the nominated property, in which the abundance of tales related to the supernatu- ral confirm how deeply rooted they are in the collective imagination. Since pre-conquest times, the sacred nature of the area, along with the associated rituals, has had a deep influence on beliefs over the centuries.The use of the sacred as a tool against evil is the common denomi- nator of these beliefs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Symbolism plays a fundamental role in the awareness of the underworld and the supernatural. The strong pres- ence of crosses at the nominated property reveals the beliefs that traditional society held regarding Christian values. According to the documentary evidence provid- ed by Luján Henríquez and Ortega Ojeda in <span class="s2">La topon- imia de Artenara </span>(2008), in this municipality alone, there are 25 place names containing the word ‘cross’. Many of these crosses represented the place of rest on the com- plicated route taken by the funeral processions, a route on which tradition had it that a stop should be made in order to pray, as a sign of respect. Some of these crosses represented the honour of the soul of the deceased, while, at the same time, marking the spot where there had been a sudden death, in which case there was no opportunity for confession or repentance. This is the case of the <span class="s2">Cruz de Cazadores</span>, in the municipality of Ar- tenara, where, according to oral tradition, two huntsmen met their death following a dispute.When the cross was destroyed, the souls of the deceased were released and were manifested in the form of a light, terrifying those who wandered through such lonely places at night. The oral tradition of the Islands has numerous tales of tor- mented souls following the profanation of crosses, such as the legend of the <span class="s2">Luz de Osorio </span>(Light of Osorio), in the <span class="s2">medianías </span>of Gran Canaria, or that of the <span class="s2">Luz de Ma- fasca </span>(Light of Mafasca), in Fuerteventura. Likewise, tales</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">of the appearance of lights related to tormented souls are very common throughout the territory of the nomi- nated property. Juan Cubas Montesdeoca, who lived in Barranco Hondo de Abajo, recounts:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">“Up there [...] in the place they call Montaña Cabrera, is where the Rama de Santo Domingo appears, they called it Las Crucitas (Little Crosses), and when there was a fire, all the crosses on the mountain burned down.Then a priest [...] erected just one cross. They have to put up others be- cause in those mountains I saw lights flying from one place to another, people who died in that area and whose souls were tormented.That’s why they put up the crosses, so their souls could rest”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">← <span class="s1">Figure 2.b.36.

The existence of this cross was already known at the end of the 17th century. Luján Henríquez has pointed out that “according to the muleteers and walkers, this place was where witches danced and this cross was probably placed in the area to drive away the phantoms and covens, or because some wayfarer had died there” (‘Programa de La Cuevita’, 1996). Accord- ing to several informants in the area, the Cruz de María was a place where lights belonging to tormented souls were seen. This is what Heraclio González Rodríguez, a resident of Coruña, pointed out:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">“They said a priest had died at the Cruz de María... and... there was even money buried there. [...] Because he was in torment there, a light appeared [...] a little light and he said that everyone saw that light, because it was on the same path”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The supernatural importance of the site is also related to ethnoastronomic aspects. Antonio Hernandez, an in- formant from Lugarejos, stated that when the star Ve- nus reached the height of the Cruz de María, the star stopped, just as it stopped wherever there was a cross- roads because, he says, of the witches.</p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In addition to the sighting of night lights, the tales of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">tormented souls are related to the nominated prop- erty through someone who was well known in the area, namely Zaragoza Cabrera Cabrera, better known as Zaragocita. This woman, who came from Lugarejos in Artenara, had the ability to speak to the deceased who were unable to find eternal peace for their souls. There are numerous accounts pointing out that she was well known and respected in the region due to this gift she possessed. The informants described her as a humble, simple woman whom souls sought when they had left something unresolved before they died. Francisca Díaz Rodríguez, who lived in Artenara, described her in the following way:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">“There was a lady down in Lugarejos, who talked to the … dead, and so many things that she said were true, that if a litre of oil were owed to the Holy Church, the relatives would pay for it […], she would hear this from the deceased”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Zaragoza, the intermediary between the earthly world and the supernatural, also interceded for those souls who needed masses to be said in the name of Saint Vincent, in order to find eternal peace. It was she who warned the relatives of the deceased that they should celebrate this ritual, which consisted of offering or at- tending the religious liturgy during thirty consecutive days, in order to pray for their soul. Once this period was over, the spirit could go forth and leave the world</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of the living.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Other recurring tales in the area of the nominated property are witches´ tales. The practice of witchcraft was very frequent in the Canary Islands as was record- ed in numerous files at the Archives of the Holy Inquisi- tion of the Canary Islands. According to Fajado Spinola (1992:493), one of the leading scholars of witchcraft and sorcery in the Canary Islands, complaints related to these practices account for 44% of those received by the Holy Office of the Inquisition in the 16th and 17th centuries. The hundreds of complaints and doz- ens of cases that appear in the Books of Testimonies, reveal how strongly rooted this belief was in the Ca- nary Islands. Jiménez Sanchéz (1955:3) pointed out that “much of Canarian superstition is reminiscent of the idolatrous and demonic practices of the natives”. These practices were to gain strength with the arrival of the Moors, Berbers, Galicians, Basques, Maltese and Flem- ish in the Canary Islands. It is not surprising, therefore, that the abundance and conservation of witches´ tales still remaining in the collective memory of our inform- ants, have encouraged this popular belief.The characters in these tales are the women who performed all kinds of hexes and enchantments. On occasions they took on the shape of an animal to carry out their misdeeds. They usually turned into she-donkeys, goats or cats that went back to their human form when they reached the crossroads. Their victims were usually men who, unable to defend themselves from the wile of women, were represented as being subject to their charms, devoid of will and easy to master. Normally, these men were lured at night through beautiful songs that guided them to places they never actually managed to reach. In addition to the survival of these tales through the oral tradition of the nominated area, there are numerous place names referring to witches, such as the “Degollada de las Bru- jas” (the witches’ mountain saddle), between Artenara and Tejeda.The presence of these women is also associ- ated with certain places in the nominated area, some of which are inaccessible, as Heraclio González Rodríguez, who lived in Coruña commented:“The witches, you see, are in places where no spider would go, [...] in a cave of the Risco de El Hornillo”. Likewise, a resident of the Vega de Acusa, Amor Medina Díaz, related the following:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">“They say they flew before, they say they threw a ball to one another: here comes the ball, if you want it, you want it, and if not, you throw it away.” They came here between the Vega and the Mesa, throwing the ball to each other. [...] They flew, turned into goats, cows, whatever they wanted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">[...] In El Toscón neighbourhood the practice was rife. There, there really was witchcraft”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In these tales, Christian symbols frequently became the main means to drive the witches away or expose them. A bolt or a pair of scissors in the shape of a cross placed under the pillow served as an amulet for protection against the misdeeds of these women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Anything sacred was also used to combat or prevent other evils. Since ancient times, in the Canary Islands, the reciting of prayers has been used in popular heal- ing practices, sometimes accompanied by certain rituals. The people who perform these healings are generally known as <span class="s2">santiguadoras, curanderas </span>or <span class="s2">rezanderas</span>, and the prayers that are recited to cure the ‘patients’, are known as <span class="s2">rezados </span>or <span class="s2">santiguados</span>. In the area of the nominated property, some prayers to cure the evil eye or erysipelas have been recorded, and can still be found in other parts of the Archipelago. Among the amulets which, according to popular belief, enable these evils to be avoided or, at least, diminished, is a cross drawn on the back, the wearing of something red, or verses of the gospels kept in a small embroidered bag.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">As has been shown, familiarity with the religious be- liefs and popular spirituality existing in the area of the nominated property provides another example of the cultural wealth of the property, characterised by a view of the world which is strongly linked to land, sky and symbolism.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.39.

As in all societies, this great event was bound by strict rules that were accepted and perpetuated by the community.The dead were the ancestors who gave rise to the present and who left a legacy of history, identity and land.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The archaeological landscape of the Sacred Mountains of Gran Canaria cannot be fully understood without giving due consideration to the places where these secluded inhabitants were laid to rest. This part of the island is distinctive in that it is home to several burial grounds where the mass deaths and individual losses of this people were internalised as a norm of society through the practice of funeral rites. These places were enclosed and designed to endure the passage of time. They were also directly linked to the settlements where the activities of everyday life took place.They were, and continue to be, landmarks in the lived space that were explained and understood through tradition and history, thus becoming essential generators and references of the collective memory.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">These burial sites are found near living spaces or ad- jacent to domestic structures. Archaeological evidence shows that the dead played an important role in the ar- eas of everyday life - perhaps to normalise death. It was possibly also an expression of their cosmogony, which apparently remained unchanged throughout its entire history (Alberto et al., 2013-2014). From this perspec- tive, the social landscape of the ancient inhabitants of the Canary Islands is perceived as a continuum that in- cludes all members of the community, both living and dead and where everyday life unfolded in a specific area where each had his place and purpose.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">← <span class="s1">Figure 2.b.40.View of the Tejeda Basin, a space containing numerous burial caves of the ancient Canarians.</span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© Javier Gil León</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">These burial grounds are highly complex and vary con- siderably in terms of size, types of funeral structures used, how corpses were treated and the internal organi- sation that articulated relations between the different sepulchres, and their continued use over time (Alberto <span class="s2">et al</span>., 2013-2014; Alberto, 2014). For this reason, sev- eral burial sites of different types have been preserved, some of which contain hundreds of tombs and most of which contain a number of sepulchres. Archaeological findings confirm that the large necropolises were as- sociated with the important settlements located along the island’s most important ravines, while the smaller burial grounds formed part of the smaller settlements. The smaller burial grounds also have all of the funeral structures and these are found right across the island from the highlands to the coastal areas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Types of funeral structures include burial mounds, cists, graves and caves. In most cases, these structures house one main individual sepulchre where corpses were laid out in the supine position. However, recent archaeo- logical findings have revealed exceptions to this practice. Some individuals were placed in the prone position and there were also some collective sepulchres most of which had individual internment structures (Alberto and Velasco, 2008; Alberto, 2014). Some large burial grounds contain burial mounds only, while others are comprised exclusively of graves dug out of the ground. One difference, aside from the architectural aspects of the tombs, is whether or not the dead were interred. In the case of burial mounds, cists and caves, corpses were not covered with earth and sepulchres were sealed off with stones. On the other hand, individuals consigned to graves, and cists in some cases, were interred.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The amount of work invested in the different sepul- chres varies.The same is true of the quality of the funer- al shroud and the types of physical activity carried out by the people buried in these places.This would suggest that, beyond kinship, the social status of the individuals also influenced how the burial grounds were arranged</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 295pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">be seen in the variable quality of the shrouds (Alberto and Velasco, 2009; Santana et al., 2011-2012; Alberto <span class="s2">et al., </span>2013-2014;Velasco et al., 2016).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.41.

The standard manner in which corpses were wrapped would lead us to assume that specialists were trained to perform this task, as indi- cated in ethnohistorical sources that mention the exist- ence of men and women whose job it was to prepare corpses (Morales Padrón, 2008; Abreu Galindo, 1977). However, this did not mean that no differentiation was made between individuals. Indeed, a clear distinction can</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 2.b.42.

(Alberto, 2014; Delgado <span class="s2">et al., </span>prensaa), which is in keeping with findings from settlements and collective granaries that place the main indigenous occupation of the island between the 5<span class="s9">th </span>and 15<span class="s9">th </span>centuries A.D. During these 900 years of history the island landscape housed all of the typologi- cal categories that are characteristic of burial sites on islands (burial mounds, caves, cists and graves).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Interestingly, the oldest cave radiocarbon dating ema- nates from burial sites located within the nominated property, specifically from the burial grounds in the ar- chaeological ensembles of Cuevas del Rey-Andén de Tabacalete (Tejeda) and Acusa (Artenera). The dates corresponding to these sites range from between the 3rd and 8th centuries A.D. and were obtained from the skins of shrouds on a mummified body and also from wood, indicating that the caves were one of the first structures to house the remains of the dead. This tradi- tion continued for a considerable period of time - in Risco Chimirique (Tejeda) radiocarbon dating suggests the 13th century.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">En el paisaje arqueológico de los Espacios Sagrados de The archaeological landscape of the Sacred Mountain of Gran Canaria includes numerous burial sites with rep- resentations of all the site types found in the rest of the island. However, the difficult terrain and badlands or malpais lacking large flat areas arrested the develop- ment of large tumular necropolises like that at Maipés de Agaete or Arteara in San Bartolomé de Tirajana. Al- though we have important tumular necropolises such as Lomo de la Pimienta or Túmulos de la Portada in Tirma, the area features a multitude of tumuli that are inaccessible, to a greater or lesser extent, such as those at Aserrador, Los Marrubios, Degollada de la Ruda or Degollada del Gigante, amongst others. However the large cave necropolises associated with inhabited ar- eas such as those at Roque Bentayga, Cuevas del Rey, Acusa or Montaña del Humo are the most common in the area. Unfortunately, osteoarchaeological research in this part of the island is anecdotal and cases are rarely published.The most recent excavation was at the Risco Chimirique overhang, where a deposit containing three individuals has been documented (1 adult and 2 infants).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">This site had been repurposed as a burial place after it had been used as a living space (Martín <span class="s2">et al., </span>2003).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In addition to the important troglodyte settlement and collective granaries at Mesa de Acusa, there is also an important funeral area. Indeed some of the mummies that are kept at Museo Canario come from here.These include no. 5, which belongs to a woman over 50 years of age, who was wrapped in a shroud made of reed and pigskin and no. 20, belonging to a child of between 2 to 3 years of age also wrapped in reed and skin.The excel- lent environmental conditions in these caves favoured the natural mummification of the human remains. Roque Bentayga and the adjacent rocks, including Cuevas del Rey and Andén del Tabacalete, also constitute an impor- tant troglodyte archaeological ensemble with dwelling caves, granaries and burial areas. Some mummies and partially mummified human remains come from this site.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Indeed, mummies are one of the outstanding features of Gran Canaria’s archaeology and particularly of the archaeological landscape of the Sacred Mountain Sites. Of the 23 that are housed in Museo Canario, an im- portant percentage comes from the burial sites of Acusa and Cuevas del Rey-Andén de Tabacalete. Most of these were recovered during archaeological explora- tions sponsored by the museum between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Despite the fact that Gran Canaria’s mummies have been associated with Egyptian mummification, archaeo- logical and anthropological evidence rule out the use of an embalming technique to intentionally preserve bod- ies. The indigenous people used a consistent method which involved shrouding their corpses. Furthermore, the mummies from Gran Canaria are shrouded bodies that were partially reduced to skeletal form while the skins and plant fibres used in making the burial shroud remain in good condition. That is, in most cases the mummy is the shroud and not the individual inside it. Notwithstanding the above, in certain cases, such as in- fant mummy no. 20 from Museo Canario, a good part of the soft tissue has been preserved as a result of natural mummification (Delgado et al., en prensab). Firstly, this suggests that the islanders knew that the treatment they applied to the corpses would not ensure preservation (Delgado et al., en prensaa). Secondly, it is evident that these mummifications were the result of the environ- mental conditions of the sepulchral sites and the qual- ity of the wrappings. Indeed, all the preserved mum- mies were found in caves where conditions were ideal</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">for preserving organic matter. This does not mean that the ancient inhabitants of the Canary Islands did not use plant, animal or mineral ointments when preparing corpses for interment (as mentioned in ethnohistorical sources), rather that these actions may have been to purify the body or may have formed part of symbolic rituals, as occurs in many cultures (Alberto <span class="s2">et al</span>., 2013- 2014; Delgado <span class="s2">et al.</span>, <span class="s2">in press</span>).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.43.View of the necropolis in a cave in Andén del Tabacalete in the Bentayga Highlands (Tejeda).</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© José Juan Guillén Medina</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2.b.x</p><h2 style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The forests of the sacred mountains:</h2><h2 style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">rites and celebrations over the course of history</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 37pt;text-align: left;">T</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: right;">he population of the island has always had, and continues to have a relationship with the forests that goes beyond the purely economic and subsistence aspects. Hence, apart from being suitable ecosystems for obtaining building materials, forage for the livestock, food, medicinal herbs or fuel for heating, cooking or light, some of the forests around the nominated prop- erty, basically pine trees, attained, and continue to attain a symbolic significance; either from a magical, religious spiritual point of view, or even as sources of collective identity, that have gone beyond the boundaries of time and have been kept irrespective of the cultural changes that have occurred throughout the historical evolution</p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">of the island.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">It has already been said that Tirma was described by the chroniclers as one of the sacred places of pre-colonial Gran Canaria (Morales Padrón, 1978), and as a place name, it is currently associated with the Tabadaba Pine Forest, and more specifically with the western slopes of this mountain range, where Canary Island pines abound, together with other endemic species that have driven its declaration as a Nature Park.

And how, in turn, the trees and forests were related to the rain and fertility. In fact, we have references to certain rites performed by the aboriginal communities of the island to bring the rains, in which they say that “<span class="s2">with all of them carrying staffs in their hands, they went down to the sea shore, and they also carried tree branches, and along the way, they looked up at the sky and cried out, raising both arms with their hands stretched out, they asked for rain for their crops</span>” (Morales Padrón, 1978).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">We do not know whether these rituals were taken over or included in some fashion in the Catholic teachings imposed on them after the European conquest of Gran Canaria. Whether they were diluted to a certain extent, into processes of religious syncretism, with the seeds sewn years before the conquest by Evangelist missions undertaken by both clerics and laymen from Majorca in the late 14<span class="s10">th </span>century, aimed at converting what was seen as a “pagan and animist” population to Christian- ity. One example of these early missions to spread the gospel was the arrival of a group of these Majorcans on the island, who married and had children with Canarian women, and were even granted land and livestock (Az- nar and Tejera, 1994).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">These proselyting ministries appeared to have been successful in their purpose, at least with regard to part</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">of the population, as Torriani points out “they indoctri- nated the Canarians in all things, in government and in the rites and ceremonies they performed to God” (Tor- riani, 1978). Another part of the community was hostile to this indoctrination process, as can be deduced from the murder of thirteen Majorcan friars in the late 14<span class="s9">th </span>century (Aznar and Tejera, 1994), although, with the vic- tory of the Castilian troops in the war waged between 1478 and 1483, anyone who had not embraced Chris- tianity, had to convert as another of the impositions of the process of conquest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">These mechanisms of cultural assimilation implemented for over a century, may be reflected in myths such as the appearance of Our Lady of the Pine Tree (La Virgen del Pino), who was to become the patron saint of the Catholic population of the island until the present day. She is said to have appeared in a massive pine tree, along with a stone tablet adorned with petroglyphs in the form of feet and a spring (Morales Padrón, 1978). Another possible reflection of this, which took root af- ter the conquest, could be the custom of decorating churches and religious figures with branches of trees and aromatic plants during Christian festivities, which sometimes acted as offerings. This practise appears to have been accepted in the new colonial society by the aborigines and their descendants, such as María Telles, descendent of aboriginal Canarian Sánchez de Bentida- gua, who was the Mayor of Agaete. In his will, he be- queathed some land to Juan Manuel, resident of Acusa, and his heirs on the condition that he had to provide the necessary branch for the festivities of Our Lord of Acusa “for ever and ever” (Luján Enríquez, 2004).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">We do not have firm data that enables us to directly link the “enramadas” (carrying branches) with the in- digenous traditions assimilated into Catholicism, but it is striking that these “enramadas” are also celebrated in the fiestas of Socorro del Güimar (Tenerife), where people carried pine or basil branches as part of the rit- ual, or in the festivities of La Cruz in Los Realejos, where the streets were decorated with pine branches brought down from the forest the night before (Galván Tudela, 1987). Curiously, in Güimar, where a large contingent of the Guanche population was kept because of the distance, the distribution of land among the Canarians who took part in the conquest was particularly gener- ous. It would appear that some of these natives held important social positions in this area during the 16<span class="s10">th </span>century (Betancor, 2002). We also know that the pres- ence of the indigenous population of Gran Canaria was</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.45.

For instance, María Doramas, daughter of aboriginal Ca- narian conqueror Juan Doramas, donated the sites and paid for the building works for the Church of Santiago there, or the presence of Canary Island native Rodrigo el Cojo as the steward of the brotherhood of San Se- bastián in El Realejo (Betancor, 2002).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">At this point, we should ask whether the role of these Canary Island native conquerors, who even held in- stitutional posts, some, such as Juan Delgado, perhaps the Faycan (chief or lord) of Gáldar and the first mayor of the Cabildo (Island Council) of Tenerife (Betancor, 2002), may have had some kind of influence on certain aspects of religious rituals, such as decorating with tree branches.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">For all these reasons, it would not appear to be beyond the realms of possibility to think about these processes of symbiosis and in adopting aboriginal customs in the rituals performed under the new religious blanket of Catholicism, to facilitate maintaining control over the natives and their acceptance of the new ideology, es- pecially if we consider some information that points in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 295pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">the nominated property, and which have close ties with the Tamadaba pine forests: the “Ramas” of Juncalillo, El Valle and Agaete, the latter is now both and island-wide festivity and also a regional holiday, as a symbol of ethnic identity as it has ties with the aboriginal past.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 295pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Apart from the fact that it is the most popular and fa- mous (it is traditionally attended by large crowds), ac- cording to the historical information available, La Rama de Agaete, held on the 4<span class="s9">th </span>of August, on the eve of Our Lady of the Snows, is the oldest. The worship of this figure dates back to 1481 at least, when Alonso Fernán- dez de Lugo, conqueror and governor of the Fortress of Agaete, set up a hermitage at that time next to the tower, devoted to Our Lady. The celebration may have been held since that time. Although we know nothing about its oldest features or components, we do know that the Hermitage has been adorned with branches during these festivities since the 1530s.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.46. “Rama de San Pedro”. Coming down from the forest</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to the fiesta after collecting the branches</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© José Juan Guillén Medina</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">this direction, but referring to the sub-Saharan popula- tion used as slave labour in the sugar mills from the late 15<span class="s9">th </span>century and during the 16<span class="s9">th </span>century. This infor- mation bears witness to the use of borrowing “pagan” cultural customs for Christian rituals. Thus, according to the book of the Brotherhood of San Juan de Telde, in their processions “black slave dances were performed and danced that rang the bells that they tied to their legs and they struck the skin of the tambourine in time to the music” (Hernández Benítez, 1958).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">But this symbolic, religious, sentimental or festive bond is not only evident in historical records, they can also be seen today in popular expressions, rituals and festivities associated with certain anniversaries, where the vegeta- tion component, branches, and by extension, the forest, is an essential part of the ceremony and the celebration. This is the celebration known as the <span class="s2">Rama (Branch) </span>or <span class="s2">Bajada de La Rama (Bringing Down the Branch)</span>. We can name three “ramas”, as the most deep-rooted, that are held in two of the municipal districts that form part of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">For now, we do not know how the church and the streets were adorned; whether the branches were prof- fered as offerings, as is the custom now, whether this tradition of adorning with branches-offering is a custom borrowed from the aboriginal population, or whether other ethnic components of other origins formed part of the origins of this tradition, as happened in Telde with the Brotherhood of San Juan, in an area in which the indigenous and sub-Saharan population was large after the conquest. We do have information for the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19<span class="s9">th </span>century on the spending made on the Church of Las Nieves for the “branch brought from the pine forest for the show of <span class="s2">Our Lady</span>”, for the drummer and “palms for the festivity” (Cruz and Cruz, 2012). This reference to the drummer boy tells us that music already formed an im- portant part of the celebration. In fact, in 1867, it was an essential part of the festivities and the Branch was carried into the church accompanied by the band, after being carried in procession through the town streets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Nowadays, all the aforementioned celebrations with branches, with some variations and nuances, have a similar ritual and symbolic component and they are as- sociated with a Christian festivity: in the case of Jun- calillo, Santo Domingo de Guzmán; San Pedro in the Agaete Valley and Our Lady of the Snows in the case of Agaete. By the same token, the essential element in all these festivities is the branch, either a pine branch or from another species found in the pine forest, such as mint or heather. Modern participants in La Rama de</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">San Pedro go up to the Tamadaba Pine Forest the night before and come down the following morning, the time of the celebration, with large branches that they offer to San Pedro after a day of dancing to the music of bands, which start playing at ten o’clock in the morning. In La Rama de Agaete, there are still people who follow the tradition of going up to the pine forest in search of the branch, as they do in El Valle for San Pedro, these are usually now available, having been cut the day before, where the dancing takes place. This is also the case for La Rama de Juncalillo.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Another essential component of these celebrations is the music played by wind and percussion bands, accom- panied by “papahuevos” (giants and figures with gigan- tic heads), who play for hours while the crowds dance through the streets of the town hosting the celebration, with the branches held high, to the traditional beat and rhythm that is an inseparable part of the tradition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The other element that we can highlight in the “Bajadas de la Rama” (Bringing down the Branch) we have men- tioned is their role as a religious offering. After hours of frenzied dancing, participants in the ritual lay out their branches at the feet of the saint or virgin as a promise. This religious component or character is not incompat- ible, in the case of La Rama de Agaete, with the change</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">in purpose allocated to the festival in the second half of the 19<span class="s9">th </span>century, when it became associated with the indigenous ritual of praying for rain that was described at the beginning. It is now the living expression of an ethnic identity bond with the original communities of the island and a reference point.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.47. “La Rama de Agaete”.This is currently the largest of the “enramadas”.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">© Javier Diepa</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.48. “Fiesta de la Rama” in Juncalillo de Gáldar with giants and big heads in 1954 © FEDAC.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">&#39; <span class="s12">.</span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 510pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 507pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 45%;text-align: left;"><span class="s14">, </span><span class="s15">.</span><span style=" color: #977B69;">.... </span><span style=" color: #000;">.</span>.<span class="s19">&#39;</span>..<span class="s20">,.,.</span></p><p class="s23" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: right;"><span class="s21">&quot;</span><span class="s22">&#39;-&#39; </span>--<span style=" color: #AC9587;">:</span>-</p><p class="s25" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">, ... <span class="s26">&quot; </span><span class="s27">;..</span><span class="s28">..</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s29" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 24pt;text-align: right;">&#39; <span class="s30">1</span></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 25pt;text-align: left;"><span class="h1">·1 </span>,<span style=" color: #7C6659;">--</span>.</p><p class="s32" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: right;">.<span class="s33">.</span><span class="s34"> </span><span class="s35">.</span>·<span class="s36">.</span>·<span style=" color: #977B69;">.,</span></p><p class="s36" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">&#39;<span class="s35">-   </span><span class="s38">: :c</span>-<span class="s37">•</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">....,&#39;&quot;&#39;°&quot; <span style=" color: #AC9587;">.</span></p><p class="s25" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">. \,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s40" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 54%;text-align: right;">- <span class="s41">. &lt;- </span><span class="s42">:- </span><i>&#39;</i><span class="s13">&#39;&quot;</span><span class="s44">! &quot; </span><span class="s45">&quot; </span><span class="s46">... </span><span class="s47">&#39;</span></p><p class="s52" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 28pt;text-align: right;"><span class="s48">.</span><span class="s49">   </span><span class="s50">-</span><span class="s51">.</span>.<span class="s20">.</span><span class="s51">.</span>.<span class="s20">.</span><span class="s53">.</span>.<span class="s20">   </span><span class="s54">_</span><span class="s55">-</span><span class="s54">,  </span><span class="s56">-</span><span class="s57">-</span><span class="s24">.</span><span class="s57">--</span><span class="s58"> </span><span class="s59">.</span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">273</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">2.b.xi</p><h2 style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The historical evolution and knowledge of the property through sources and research</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 35pt;text-align: left;">T</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">he island of Gran Canaria was inhabited by a culture that we now recognise generically as the culture</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">of the ancient Canarians for at least one thousand, five hundred years, as we have shown. That was what those people were called, as they are today. It was their title. One of the outstanding aspects of those people, in the context of the cultures of the past, is that they were the island expression of that Amazigh world which devel- oped in isolation up until the 14th century, when spo- radic contacts were made with European sailors, priests and merchants, and above all, the 15th century, when the islands were finally conquered.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The oldest reference to the islands is from King of Mau- retania Juba II, born in the heart of the Numidian impe- rial family and an ally of Rome, who in the beginning of our era sent a political-scientific expedition to the Canary Islands, or the Fortunatae Insulae, as he called them, the results of which were consigned to the treaty on Libya (6 AD).This information was collected decades later by the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder and thus became the only transmitted source of this fundamental text on the early history of the islands (García, 2015). After Pliny, silence hung over the islands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In the 14<span class="s9">th </span>Century, Nicolo da Recco, the first docu- mented European navigator to arrive on the Canary Islands, broke the silence with his account of his voyage. The value of this document lies in the fact that it is a direct testimony and not a transcription.Without doubt, the most interesting part of the document is a small linguistic survey carried out on four men that were tak- en prisoner in Canaria (Gran Canaria). With the help of gestures, the seafarers asked them to count in their language and transcribe the result into Latin characters. The result was surprising: The canarios counted from 1 to 16 in Berber! Of the 16 numbers mentioned, 13</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">were identical to their current counterparts in the dia- lects that have maintained the ancient numbering sys- tem (the Tachelhit in Morocco and above all the Tuareg dialects of central Sahara): <span class="s2">yan, sin, kraD, kkuZ, smmus, sDis, sa, ttam, tZa, mraw, yan de mraw, sin de mraw, kraD d mraw. </span>For the historians, this linguistic annexe is proof of an irrefutable fact: the inhabitants of the Canary Islands spoke Berber in the 14th Century. Many centuries after the first text from Juba/Pliny, it has been recorded that these territories were populated by people whose ori- gins we can identify through their language: the north- west of Africa, where a large number of Berber dialects are still in use. We are talking about a vast territory that is referred to generically as Tamazgha (the Berber World) to distinguish it from Egypt and the sub-Saharan world (Boukouss, 2015).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">However, if we take into consideration the long time during which the island was occupied by the insular Amazighs, their isolation from the outside world, even the other islands - Nicolo da Recco’s document men- tions the absence of ships - and the extreme adapta- tions to unique ecosystems, it is no surprise that we find a unique and distinguished culture that evolved from its</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">← <span class="s1">Figure 2.b.49.

In the case of the island of Gran Canaria, this culture reached a surprising level of development: “<span class="s2">The people that live there are a great people, thought to include 6,000 noblemen alongside those of other status</span>” (Bontier, Leverrier, 1980: (67-68).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The discovery of a small cave just two decades ago, led to many aspects of the scope and level of development</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.52.

And this is what has occurred, amongst other things, in attempts to under- stand the constructive precision of this cave and the un- paralleled light phenomenon that occurs in it. The light of the sun and moon enter the cave at certain times of the year, intentionally creating an astronomical marker. This light phenomenon also produces a succession of images of great symbolic significance, particularly in part of the cave that is covered in rock art in the form of inverted triangles that are thought to represent pubic triangles. Although some of these elements are present in other places and in other elements of the culture of the ancient inhabitants of the islands, nowhere else do they combine so perfectly and beautifully as in the site at Risco Caído.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">This discovery not only paved the way for a new area of research but also contributed to a better understanding and deeper appreciation of the importance of other sites on the island that are already known. This is what occurred in  certain enclaves  in the  island  highlands, where very important elements related to astronomical and symbolic practices and, in general, to the religion of those people are identified. These are unique elements that were sacralised, either through the intervention of humans who constructed temples in caves or outdoors or through the symbolic recognition of certain geo- graphical landmarks that stood out on the landscape.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">References to the sacred nature of the mountains</h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">As occurred in Berber Maghreb, a substantial part of the sacralised elements are located in the mountain areas, and these are evident in the many attributes of the proposed Cultural Landscape in Gran Canaria. The most elevated and unique sites were selected so that, in keeping with Berber thinking, the mountain benefited from their presence, becoming a sacred source and at the same time an object and place of worship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">The highlands are replete with sacred forces and these superior heights are integrated with the transcendent, the superhuman. The symbolic and religious values of the mountains are very diverse. They are considered the meeting point of sky and land and thus, as the <span class="s2">axis mundi, </span>whereby the celestial vault was held up by a pillar supporting the two physical realities - the sky and the land- and, by extension, the two worlds, the higher and the underworld, in which good spirits but also evil be- ings were found.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">The view of the mountains being sacred is also sup- ported by several references in ethnohistorical sources that suggest that certain mountains and indeed certain large areas in the highlands were sacred for the ancient people: “<span class="s2">.. and these Canarians had sanctuaries on two cliffs called Tirma and Cimarso, each of which were two leagues in circumference, bordering the sea. They were safeguarded and revered like churches, meaning that any wrongdoer that took refuge in these mountains was free and safe and could not be removed from there if he did not want to be</span>”. (Ovetense 1993 (1478), XXII, 161). The sacred nature of these places also meant that vows were also taken here: “<span class="s2">And as we here safeguard the holy house of Jerusalem they vowed allegiance to Tirma and to Margo</span>” (<span class="s2">asistis Tirma </span>and <span class="s2">asitis Margo</span>) (Ovetense 1993 (1478), XXII, 161).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">In these places, “<span class="s2">The houses of religious women were sa- cred for delinquents, they called them Tamogante en Acorán, which means the house of God.They had another house on a high cliff called Almogaren, which is a sacred house; there they invoked and made sacrifices, sprinkling milk each day, which their God above looked down upon and they kept livestock for this purpose. They also went to two very high</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">cliffs: Tirmah in the area of Gáldar, and another in Tirahana called humiaia and white cliffs. With utmost solemnity they uttered their vows amidst these twin crags to which they came in procession with palm branches and the Maguas or virgins with their pitchers of milk to sprinkle; they called out and raised their hands and faces to the heavens and circled the rocky ridge and descended from here to the sea to thrash it with their branches<span class="p">”.

And it is likewise very probable, although we only have some indicators of it, that in these places pacts were made between the different fractions or groups of kinship of the island, according to the model of organisa- tion in which they were structured politically.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.53.

The existence of places of worship used collectively, in pre-eminent sites, lend the ritual a more extensive character, not only in the perception of a larger landscape and the identification of specific landmarks, but through the actual movement to these places that also formed part of the ritual, in the form of processions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.55.

Also of interest are certain marks or scratches on the rocks, symbolising recollections of the past, that are cited by some of the chroniclers: “<span class="s2">… and for nine days running they held big Dances and banquets and weddings, and having harvested their crops they carved lines into slabs, walls or rocks; they said that these referred to tara and tarja</span>” (Marín (1694:</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">(74) 1986: 254]. There is also mention of sacred routes and pilgrimages to these places: “<span class="s2">All of the people fol- lowed these up to the highest cliff they could reach; and there, after praying and offering up the alms to God, abun- dant milk was sprinkled on the land as a first offering, after which the people were discharged and returned in proces- sion to their abodes</span>” (F. Morales Padrón-A. Sedeño, 1978: 373).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Finally, we have an interesting reference by the engineer Leonardo Torriani in the 16<span class="s9">th </span>Century to the way of life of this people, and in particular, to their religious practices that reaffirmed the value of the mountains and highlands for these practices: “<span class="s2">on top of the highest cliff that they could climb…</span>” Torriani goes on to reflect on how “<span class="s2">The search for God on the mountain tops has also been seen amongst other gentiles, the name given by Aristotle to those that lived in Olympus; they climbed the highest peak of that mountain each year to make their sacrifices, likewise believing that Jupiter was found there, or wanting to get as close to it as they could,…</span>” (Torriani, 1978:103-104).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Story of the discovery</h3><h3 style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and archaeological research</h3><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">There is a surprising amount of material remnants of the ancient inhabitants of the Canary Islands that re- main to this day - five centuries after the demise of that society - and this is particularly true of the Cultural Landscape area. Despite the intense occupation and transformation of much of the land in the rest of the island in the 20<span class="s9">th </span>century and the first decade of the 2<span class="s9">st </span>Century (particularly the flat land along the coast) and despite the exponential demographic growth in Gran Canaria in this period, much of that material culture has survived in privileged areas such as this.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Caldera de Tejeda truly escaped the urban and popula- tion development experienced in the rest of the island as its distinctly rural character and most relevant natural landscapes have been preserved intact.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Archaeological research has devoted a considerable amount of study to this continuum of the culture, which has its own history too, combining and compensating in a difficult balancing act between what has been lost from that legacy on an island level, with what is being rediscovered using more accurate and systematic strat- egies and techniques alongside those findings that occur by happy coincidence. The discovery of the dome cave at Risco Caído is a clear example of this for Science.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">We can track the cultural heritage of this people and the footprint on the landscape through varied sources of information, particularly through documents of dif- ferent types that make reference, generally indirectly, to many tangible expresions of their culture. Examples of this are information from notarial records, wills, land reg- isters etc. In many cases these documents make direct reference to material elements of the culture, as we can see from the following quote:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="s2">…Gonzalo de Quintana resident of Gáldar… leases a plot of dry, unirrigated arable land in the area of Gáldar in Facaracas… which borders the High Cliff and the ravine that runs down from Rehoya and a Canarian house and yard … with water discharging into the Agaete ravine...</span>” (1546. Doc. 244. Page 369)..</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">We can find some references from before the 19th Cen- tury (when proper archaeological study commenced), where the authors of documents explicitly recognise the material remains of that people. This type of quote is found in many written accounts about life on the Gran Canaria based on the old chronicles from the conquest that directly observe some of the material remains of the first inhabitants of the islands and thus constitute the first historical accounts of their past. Marín de Cubas, describes remains of the ancient Canarians observed in the 17th Century, for zones near the area of influence of the nominated property:“.<span class="s2">..some of the caves are very big and long and they are interconnected. They have doors or windows for lighting, some of which have small entrances, and inside there are long cavities replete with the bones of the dead, others are suspended from the steep cliffs and contain mirlados (embalmed bodies) and bones, and parts of which are so high that only birds can reach them, some are entered suspended by ropes; some things appear to be the work of the devil or to have been created in league with him; on steep cliffs they lived in huge caves inside of which large and strong timbers and beams are found, examples of this can be seen on the highest cliffs of Azuage ravine where lumbers are fitted and slotted into each other below</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">overhanging rocky projections that surround the cliff like the brim of a hat which prevented the lumbers from being lowered from above, and it is not known why they did this.<span class="p">” (Marín de Cubas; 1986; 264-265).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">These source documents are very important as they are saddled between the chronicles that were written from a clear position of being distanced from and op- posing those people that either had not succumbed and formed part of the “other” to whom one must succumb or who, years later, already subdued, still spoke nostalgi- cally about the memories they had of the descendants of the ancient inhabitants and an idealised view of the “good savage” as postulated largely by Viera y Clavijo.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The first chronicles include some quotes that directly mention the tangible evidences observed or places rec- ognised in the area at the time by the chroniclers:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.56.

From notarial documents from the year 1667, Pedro Quintana compiles some interest- ing information about the Bentayga mountain range: “Fi- nally, in Tejeda, worthy of special mention is the Farallón del Bentaiga cliff, where various archaeological sites are found (El Chorrillo, Cueva del Guaire, Almogaren del Roque). El Roque was located in the farmstead of the same name, which was sold twice in the second third of the 17th Century. It was sold by the island council to Juan de Ávila and, subsequently, he transferred it to Cris- tóbal Pérez Segura, who mentioned that he owned a flat area inside where <span class="s2">there are quesesitas </span>(cheese mak- ing area) <span class="s2">and a Canarian cave</span>” (Quintana, 2016).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">But it was not until the middle of the 19<span class="s9">th </span>Century that archaeology started to become popular among the Il- lustrated, the scholars and the scientific institutions. It was only then that the first proper archaeological work commenced or, at least, studies based on intentionally scientific premises applied to prehistoric and anthro- pological themes. These studies were more concerned with material evidence than with replication and inter- pretation of inherited historical texts. There was an in-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.58.

The discovery of Cro- Magnon man, the growing interest in racial anthropol- ogy, linguistic studies and the proximity of the Canary Islands to the European colonial expansion into con- tinental Africa, led to many new studies on the islands’ past and their first inhabitants - not just by local re- searchers like Gregorio Chil y Naranjo, Millares Torres and Sabino Berthelor, a French doctor based on the islands - but also by eminent European scientists such as René Verneau who stayed on the islands for a pro- longed period of time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In any case, the sacred mountain area in the interior of the island was still uncharted territory for historical studies at that time with the exception of the descrip- tions by Grau Bassas and some quotations from René Verneau about his trip through some of the island’s in- terior.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Where reference is made to archaeological remains in the highlands of Gran Canaria, particularly part of the Caldera de Tejeda area, what are specifically mentioned are the architectural remains of the ancient inhabitants of the islands and particularly the survival of their cave settlements, some of which were considerably large and inaccessible. It is here that significant findings of skulls were made. Intangible culture is also given a mention, though more as an aside. This is a transfer of the sub- ject described in the old texts and, at the same time, it shows a certain concern for the surviving vestiges of this culture and the rediscovery - for science - of the growing cultural heritage of the ancient Canarians.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">We say that the culture of the ancient people was re- discovered for science, because, for the inhabitants of these places that live with and indeed use these ves- tiges on a daily basis, heritage includes what is seen as a continuum of their culture, as well as what breaks away from tradition. Said culture continues to exist in the area and in the territory and, as such, also forms part of the imaginary of the rural population, as we can see, for example, in the place names. However, the troglodyte world and, in particular, the settlements of artificial caves should above all else, be considered central elements of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 2.b.59.

Thus, we know that nothing was known of the impressive survival of the surface architecture of the antiguos ca- narios because the territory in which it was found was simply not known, something which largely occurred in the interior part of Gran Canaria, where large cave set- tlements proliferated. Many of these were reused, which meant that they were not really observed from a strictly archaeological viewpoint.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">It was not until the last third of the 19th Century that scientific studies commenced and the role of certain institutions like the Museo Canario started to mark an exponential growth in information about the culture of the ancient islanders. Local researchers such as Millares Torres or foreigners like René Verneau made huge con- tributions to our understanding of the material culture of the indigenous people. It was in this time that in- formation on the architectonic remains of the primitive population of the island started to multiply, and the first references were made to the archaeological heritage of the highlands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The work of the curator of Museo Canario,Víctor Grau Bassas, carried out under difficult personal circumstanc- es deserves special mention. Without understating his</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">interest in studying the past and his scientific work, it has to be acknowledged that it was his years spent hidden away in the interior of Gran Canaria, many of which were spent in Caldera de Tejeda, that gave him the op- portunity to get to know the true wonders of the built heritage of the indigenous people and incorporate it into historical and scientific knowledge (Grau Bassas, 1980). Worthy of special mention are his descriptions and drawings of emblematic troglodyte sites such as Sierra del Bentayga in the area in question. Although Berthelot, and later, René Verneau or Olivia Stone made sketches and even took photographs of sites, Grau did so systematically, taking details of these, such as meas- urements and orientation (see Figure 2.b.17 and 2.b.18).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In terms of other types of elements of the material cul- ture of the ancient Canarians that have survived, the burial architecture is worthy of special mention, par- ticularly due to the involvement of renowned anthro- pologists that have focussed part of their studies on the funeral rites of these people. Some important outdoor burial sites were known at the beginning of the 19th Century, such as the necropolis of La Isleta, which was</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">mentioned by some of the early chroniclers such as Sedeño. Later the indigenous cemetery of Arguineguín was unveiled by Verneau and the necropolis of Arteara was visited by the Museo Canario museum. But the cave world is still the main paradigm for the material culture of this ancient people, particularly due to the impor- tant role played by Guayadeque in the 19th Century. A large number of burial grounds and mummies were also found in Guayadeque. Again, the sacred mountain sites in the highlands of Gran Canaria were late entrants into the funerary world. But it was in fact the site at Acusa and the discovery of embalmed bodies, as well as other caves in the sacred mountains, that provided the first information on the burial practices of the people that inhabited the interior of the island.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Between the 19th and 20th Centuries, sites were un- covered that drew the attention of archaeological re- search to the island, particularly the discovery of the Painted Cave, which became an icon of what was to become the popular view of the island’s past and paved the way for new lines of research, centred on the more symbolic and intangible aspects of that people.
