Suffice it to say that the collective memory still conserves the names of the “piqueros” from the second half of the 20<span class="s1">th </span>century, especially in the case of José Díaz González, known as Pepe Díaz “el del Lavadero”, as the most knowledgeable in the trade. Apart from an end- less list of “piqueros” like brothers Juan and Bernardo Díaz González (Las Moradas), Olegario Suárez (Bar- ranco Grande); Hilario and Nelito Suárez (La Charca) and Juan, Donato and Manuel Ramos (Lugarejos), Vidal Godoy (La Degollada); José and Agustín Díaz (Las Cue- vas) and Antonio Medina (Cuevas de Arriba); brothers Félix and Facio (Barranco Hondo) and other teams of cave diggers that settled in Risco Caído and Barranco Hondo, one unique feature must be added to this. Not only have there been and are well-known “piqueros”, there is actually a company specialising in work of this kind that continues to operate today (Luján Henríquez, 1994).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.a.209.Tools of the cave digger’s trade in the Ethnographic Museum of Artenara © Artenara Council</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">The uniqueness of this unusual version of a town is de- scribed by Viera y Clavijo in the late 18th century in the following terms:“<span class="s3">The floorplan of the place is very strange. In the middles of a large mountain, one can see some holes like birds’ nests. These turn out to be a large number of caves in a row, some concave like domes, others with ceil- ings, but all in community</span>” (Viera y Clavijo, 1950).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">From this time onwards, armed with new tools and resources, the cave culture managed to create a new trade in the figure of the “piquero”, the workman who excavated the cave. This was a tough and sometimes dangerous trade that required a good knowledge of the substrate to be excavated and the choice of site.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">All the work of digging out the dwelling cave was always done by hand, and it was not until 1970 that new tools like pneumatic drills and compressors were used, which were being used at the time to dig tunnels and water galleries. The “piquero” has a whole range of tools and utensils for his work, some of which were exclusively for that job, such as: the pick axe, the matlock, the two-</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">One of the features of the caves excavated over the last few centuries is that their location adapts to the terrain, giving rise to an uneven layout that follows the rule of adapting to the environment, rather than any kind of specific planning rules.They use the slopes of the moun- tains in digging caves, along with areas of impermeable rock, which isolates the cave from damp and is softer to excavate, known locally as “<span class="s3">buena tosca</span>”, or “good tuff ”. Another feature of the cave houses of this era, especially in Artenara, lies in the fact that they face south or south- west, protected from the northerly winds. Another unu- sual fact is that most of these caves are whitewashed or painted, a custom promoted after 1851 to kill the car- riers of the cholera epidemic that devastated the island.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Beyond the dwelling or specialist caves, one of the sym- bols of this trade over the course of time is embodied in the sanctuary of “La Virgen de la Cuevita” (Our Lady of the Little Cave), in Artenara. Although the original cave was probably very old, as can be deduced from its per- fect alignment with Roque Bentayga, the first record of its use as a church only dates back to the 18th century. The oldest reference to a church known as Nuestra Se- ñora de la Cuevita is to be found in the notice of masses made in 1794 by Presbyter Gaspar Montesdeoca. From that time, we know that the church was extended in 1858, and an altar was added next to the old one, along with a baptismal fount and a throne for the minister in</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">191</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">1890, the work of local worker Ramón Díaz. So, this is an expression that involves the work of several genera- tions of “piqueros”, and thus, more than just a religious monument, as it extolls the acknowledgement of the rock carvers of the Sacred Mountains.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The survival of the pottery tradition</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">One of the most significant examples of cultural survival in the nominated property is the survival of aboriginal pottery. This pottery is made by hand, without a wheel or furnace and its roots go back to the pre-Hispanic past of the island. The three major pottery production centres that followed the ancestral methods passed down from the aboriginal Canarians were in La Ata- laya, Hoya de Pineda and Lugarejos. Despite is fame and recognition, this tradition practically disappeared in the 1970s, with the exception of Lugarejos, the only pottery centre to be found within the nominated property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">This traditional style of pottery was saved from extinc- tion in extremis by urgent action taken by the Cabildo (Island Government) of Gran Canaria to come to the rescue of this heritage legacy. In 1994, only two remainng women with knowledge of this trade and the ancient pottery techniques lived in the village of Lugarejos. This is when the Cabildo of Gran Canaria bought a set of caves that had been a pottery and organised a pottery course with these last two potters (Manuela Santana and Teresa Lugo).They also reforming the caves to turn them into what is now the “Centro Locero de Lugare- jos” (Lugarejos Pottery Centre).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">At its height, the Lugarejo pottery centre met the de- mands of all the settlements of the highlands of Gran Canaria, along with the southern and south-western</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 2.a.210. “Guisadero” for pottery in Lugarejos, using the same aboriginal technique © FEDAC</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.a.211. “Guisadero” adjacent to a dwelling cave in the highlands of Artenara © FEDAC</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">slopes of the island, including the coastal settlements between the mouths of the La Aldea and Arguineguín ravines. The output of this pottery centre was so im- portant that, when they were saturated by the demand, the potters had to move their potteries to other settle- ments to make their clay pots in situ.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">The clay pottery of Lugarejos is the traditional aborigine pottery, worked by hand. The characteristic technique, “<span class="s3">urdido</span>”, or “weaving” consists of moulding the clay to- tally by hand into order to create useful objects. The pieces are made without using a wheel. But in the case of Lugarejos clay, the technique also includes a differ- ence that makes it original and genuine: the pieces of raw clay are cooked in the open air. The fuel used is what the pine forest offers: pine needles, pine cones or wood from the forest. In this case, instead of a kiln, they use a “<span class="s3">guisadero</span>” (in other words, the place where the clay is cooked – “guisar” is to cook in Spanish).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Another remarkable fact is that all the materials and instruments needed to make Lugarejos kitchenware can be found in the vicinity: the clay, the sand, the red ochre, the handles, the burnishers and even the wood. The potters collected the clay, digging it out from among the roots of the pine trees in the Tamadaba Pine Forest, which was just opposite the village. They collected the sand from the beds of nearby ravines and the red ochre dye was to be found in the veins under the nearby ba- saltic lava flows.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The process of making the pottery with this technique requires several days, of even weeks, and the pots had to be “cured” for a long time before they were baked, the key moment and the most delicate moment of the whole process of making the pottery.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The conquistadors obviously tried to introduce pottery using a wheel with its new techniques, but the plastic- ity and behaviour of the island clays made this more complicated.This attempt failed and finally, the old tech- nique was kept, the technique that had produced such magnificent expressions of pottery in the pre-Hispanic period and whose unique legacy has been recovered from the different archaeological dig sites.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">→ <span class="s2">Figure 2.a.214.

The boundaries define the visual area of reference of the landscape, encompassing the most pristine and unal- tered elements and all the scenery visible from within the basin.

It also includes many of the best ethnographic manifestations of the area, which are an expression of an outstanding territorial and scenic adaptation to the environment, such as the farming terraces or “bocados”, the ancient aboriginal trails or the small rural settle- ments. Furthermore, it is a living space full of ancestral expressions and systems of nomadic herding and water management.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The Tamadaba area contains the mythical, original Ca- nary Island pine forests, which continue to offer prac- tically the same view as the ancient Canary Islanders would have had. Throughout history, these forests have always provided the settlers of the sacred mountains with materials, resources and tools.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The different thematic maps show how the zoning established strikes a coherent compromise, especially along the boundaries, between the need to include the landscape of the Tejeda Basin and its foothills, the Tama- daba highlands and the manifestations along Barranco Hondo. It is also consistent with the cartographic in- formation provided by the leading geological elements,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">ecosystems, the environmental and cultural protection classification, the visible basins and landscape units, the urbanistic constraints and the land occupation and use system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">All the terrestrial elements related to the astronomi- cal and calendar culture of the ancient Canary Islanders are included in the area of the proposed property, thus guaranteeing the perception and integrity of the sky- scape as an essential component of the Cultural Land- scape.This includes geological landmarks such as Roque Nublo, Montaña de Altavista and Roque Palmero. This proposed Cultural Landscape also includes the main “al- mogarenes” and sanctuaries of astronomic significance, such as El Bentayga, the ritual sites of Risco Caído and other important manifestations like La Cueva de las Es- trellas (Cave of the Stars) and La Cueva del Guayre (The Guayre’s Cave).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">With the help of detailed plans on different scales, there now follows an explanation of the different areas of the Cultural Landscape and its buffer zone, with special at- tention paid to the boundaries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map 2.a.20.

The Canary Island pine survives here in almost the same splendour as it did in ancient times. It also includes the troglodyte settlement of Visvique on the northern edge, which looks down from the peaks over the sacred route of the sea towards the mountains.The ribbon of the buffer zone runs along the escarpments and crags of great scenic and ecological importance that protect the highlands to guarantee the scenic integrity of this sector.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The Tirma Sacred Landscape stands out in the western sector, so named when it was declared a Site of Cultural</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Interest. Although it does not contain any attributes or components considered to be of outstanding universal value, its archaeological manifestations and its symbolic and historic value have persuaded us to include this whole space in the buffer zone.

The most popular hypothesis today based on historical linguistics, population genetics, bioanthro- pology and archaeology appears to associate these ear- lier groups of “Berber speakers” with small groups of hunter gatherers documented in modern day Maghreb some 20,000 years ago (Chaker, 2013; Onrubia-Pintado, 2013). From this moment in time, thanks to the mo- bility of these groups, which increased in the Neolithic era with the emergence of livestock breeding, at the dawn of local protohistory paleo-amazigh populations were found throughout the Maghreb and the occupied Sahara, an immense area that runs from the western oasis of Egypt to the Atlantic African coast and from the Mediterranean coast to the very border of the Sahel. While in the areas adjacent to the Nile valley this mot- ley conglomerate of communities was in contact with Pharaonic Egypt along the entire Mediterranean coast it was connected from ancient times initially with the Phoenicians, Punic and Greeks and subsequently with the Romans. This coexistence brought about an entire series of cultural contagion dynamics, of acculturation and resistance, that operated in both directions as is always the case in such colonial situations: from colonists to colonised, but also from “indigenous” to colonisers. Despite this colonial presence and indeed some vocab- ulary loans which indicates the intensity of these rela- tions, the languages of these ancient Amazigh societies, often referred to as Lybico-Berber, were preserved and, with them, an entire cultural universe that is expressed</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">through them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Although we are still very far from fully understanding the colonisation and human settlement process on each of the Canary Islands, details available today concur that these people hailed from some of these Lybico-Berber</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">← <span class="s2">Figure 2.b.1.

Indeed all linguistic, genetic, bioanthropological and archaeological evidence that we now have coincide in indicating, beyond doubt that all the native popula- tions of the archipelago come from the continental Amazighs of ancient times.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Without ruling out the possibility of some earlier explo- ration, the arrival of the first Amazighs from the conti- nent to the islands would appear to have occurred on horseback at the beginning of the Christian era, that is, around 2000 years ago, more or less. It is clear that they came with the desire to settle here permanently, as both men and women came bringing both plants and domes- tic animals with them. We do not know exactly how the colonisation occurred: What or who drove them to cross the narrow channel that separates the islands from the continent? Did this happen in one wave or did it take various trips? How did they get here?, Where did they arrive to first and how did they move from island to island? Was settlement interrupted in some of the islands with people leaving followed by recolonisation? The only thing that we know for sure is that a time came when the continental Amazighs became islanders giving rise to a series of unique insular cultures. Thus, with the exception of the Berbers that populated the island of Yerba (Djerba, as written in French), which is</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.2.

Thus it happened that this group of people survived, bearing their offspring and continuing to grow over centuries in this cosmos now reduced to what was the land, sea and sky of the islands where they settled with their own unique ways of feeling, thinking, behaving, living in society and understanding their world. The isolation in which these people lived until the Canary Islands were “dis- covered” by the European seafarers in the 14th Cen- tury would seem to indicate that those first explorers arriving from Europe found in the islands a miraculously preserved relict of the protohistoric Amazighs living here without any contact with Islam. Even though it was by no means outlandish to believe that some remnant of the islands’ ancient culture may have still survived, the view that they were the unsullied repository of a pre-Is- lamic autochthonous culture disregarded the evolution that might have occurred within said culture. We can</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">be almost certain that there was no on-going contact between the different islands - the reason for which is unknown or not fully understand.These thus explain the accentuated differences between the Amazighs of each of the seven islands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The Amazigh cultures that settled on the Canary Islands are basically the result of colonisation, voluntary or in- duced, that was led by people that gradually became in- sular and oceanic without entirely losing their continen- tal African roots. Therein lies the exceptional historical and cultural nature of these Canarian-Amazigh people, and their islands off the coasts of Atlantic Africa.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Despite the conquest and the colonisation of the archi- pelago by Europeans, the distant echo of these people that constituted one of the formative elements of the multicultural and mixed culture society from which the modern history of the Canary Islands hails, can still be heard in each Amazigh expression (“guanchismo”) still found in the Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands. You can still hear whispers of these pre-hispanic place names, of ancient place names that they represent, thanks to the power of words to name and bring into existence the deep substrate of this material sedimentation of what is remembered and forgotten, of time and space from a distant yet recognisable time that is landscape.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.3.

Per- haps they came from one of the easternmost islands of the archipelago and, consequently were perhaps al- ready islanders. Although we have some carbon 14 dat- ing associated with human presence on the island from sometime around the beginning of the new Era, the old- est reliable dating we have for this comes from the Ben- tayga range, in the heart of the proposed Cultural Land- scape (Velasco Vázquez, 2014). This corresponds to a burial cave, integrated into an ensemble of artificial and natural caves like those known as Cuevas del Rey, in the interior of which a fragment of wood was collected that has been dated back to the 3<span class="s1">rd </span>and 4<span class="s1">th </span>Centuries. The dates from other sites situated in Acusa and also in the area of Arucas and Telde are somewhat later. It is logical to think that, if there may already have been people set- tled in the mountain regions of the island from the 3rd Century, the arrival of the first contingents of colonis- ers must have occurred somewhat earlier than this. But when? How long did this first phase of exploration and</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">adaptation last? We still do not have this information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">From the 8th Century dated sites are more prevalent on the island. And their density increases considerably for the 12<span class="s1">th </span>and 13<span class="s1">th </span>Centuries. Everything points to this moment being a phase of marked demographic growth that led to occupation of all the most favoured areas for human settlement. Significantly, analysis of myths about the island leadership collected in the written sources and the archaeological work carried out in Cueva Pin- tada de Gáldar, suggest that it is at this time that the emergence of the aristocratic lineage of the Guanar- temes occurred (Onrubia Pintado, 2003). Divided into two family lines that were based in Gáldar and Telde, these Canarian-Amazigh nobles monopolised the politi- cal and religious power of the entire island until the time</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of the conquest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">Written sources and archaeological data come together to depict a map of the island inhabited at the end of the 15th Century, just before the start of the conquest, showing some thirty places and villages in which set- tlements were concentrated. It is thought that tens of thousands of people may have lived in these towns and unknown number of small villages that made up the in- digenous settlements. In the high mountain areas the areas most densely populated at that time were Acusa, Bentayga and Artevirgo, an indigenous place name that no longer exists that most likely corresponds to the pa- gos of Barranco Hondo and Lugarejos.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">During this millennium and a half of continued pres- ence on the island, the Canarian Amazighs developed a culture that was markedly singular, unique.

Compared with the rest of the islands but also with Berber Maghreb, its particular architecture is ex- ceptional be it rock hewn or built using worked stone, found in clusters of villages made up of dwellings with unusual floor plans in dramatic cliff-top granaries or in burial mounds. And, to mention just one other case, this time related to domestic goods, also unique are productions arising from a careful clay craftsmanship aimed at modelling high-quality ceramic receptacles, often decorated with paintings, small statues or deco- rative stamps, pieces of unknown use though they are in the form of a stamp.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">In their bid to dominate nature socially, humanising it, writing their own story into its history, the Amazighs of Gran Canaria endeavoured to make their island an inhabited and habitable place. Beyond the residential and domestic areas that made up the quintessential hu- manised areas, from what we know at this point social dominance of the area started along the same coast, the configuration of which as an oceanic landscape was conditioned by its use for fishing and shellfish gather- ing that surprisingly excluded navigation. However, the island landscapes were mainly marked by the activities of this agrosylopastoral society. A considerable area was occupied by pinewoods and monteverde (sub-humid montane layer) forests which may have been the ex- pression of an untamed nature populated by unsettling creatures and spirits. Most of the agricultural land of the indigenous people was concentrated in the coast and lowlands of the north and east, with the thermo sclero- phyll strip being the most heavily used. The agricultural landscapes included parcels of irrigated land, furnished with the corresponding hydraulic systems, situated in the large plains and in the areas around the ravine riv- erbeds where water flow was sufficient. On the other hand, the dry land regions that supplied the staples of indigenous cereal production were distributed across the high lands, from the minimum annual rainfall thresh- old that made growing these crops viable. There where the land and rain allowed them to grow, fig trees pro- liferate, the only fruit tree cultivated by the natives. For its part, the livestock landscapes were made up of re- gions where flocks of sheet and goats grazed, along the trails and ropes that gave access to them, and along the shelters and pens where they found refuge on their sea- sonal trips to the mountain pastures, men and livestock.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">The nominated sacred mountains constitutes one of the most eloquent expressions of the landscapes con- structed, thought and felt by the Amazighs of the Ca- nary Islands. Here where especially sophisticated forms of symbolic domination are found, the humanised space joins hands with an idolised nature to relate perception and action, the ideal and the material, the sacred and the profane. Written sources from the time of the con- quest and from the first phases of its repopulation are unanimous in highlighting, amidst these landscapes of indigenous sacredness, the supremacy of the sanctuary</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">at Tirma. Despite the fact that this place name now has a very local character, there is plenty of data to suggest that the recurring reference in the texts refers, through the deforming colonial filter that characterise them, that this is not so much an isolated place of worship but in- stead more of a territorial boundary, marking out a vast sacred area that coincides with the Caldera de Tejeda crater. The Tirma sanctuary would thus include a good part of the highlands of the island, and particularly the Bentayga massif, the topography of which would appear to perfectly adapt itself to the setting of the ritual cliff falls that, according to some of these sources, happened here when a new “señor” of the island was appointed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">Undoubtedly because of its sacred nature, but also be- cause of its rugged terrain and because this area was so difficult to penetrate and access by the Spanish troops, Bentayga and the neighbouring regions of the centre</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">of the island were the last place of refuge for the indig- enous people of the island before the Canarian resist- ance moved in an act of desperation to the “fortresses” of the southern slopes of the island. Although it has been documented that until 1485 some islanders re- mained in the highlands, the last organised strongholds of resistance were definitively subjugated in 1483.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">However, the native islanders did not abandon the is- land highlands after the Canarian war came to an end. Indeed, from the documentation that remains we know that some of the natives were authorised by the Castil- ian crown to remain in Gran Canaria, while others could return there from exile in mainland Spain and that they had houses and lands in the regions of Lugarejos, Ar- tenara, Acusa, Bentayga or Timagada well into the 16<span class="s1">th </span>Century (Betancor Quintana, 2003).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.6.

Many of these geographic landmarks, especially in the Tejeda Caldera, were chosen to establish sites of worship or as places to hold rituals, some closely associ- ated with astronomic events. Chapter 2.a described and highlighted the sacred nature of certain archaeological sites in the mountains, such as Risco Caído, Roque Ben- tayga or Risco Chapín, all of which are important attrib-</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">utes of the nominated property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">But the fact that they were sacred did not come into conflict or contradiction with the other essential role played by these sacred mountains. As they are rugged, steep and inaccessible, they were also chosen as a ref- uge by the people who inhabited the island until they were conquered and colonised in the last quarter of the 15th century. This physical and symbolic property of the mountains as a refuge was not only attributed to them during the siege and the fight against the Euro- pean forces, when the rugged terrain of the Tejeda Cal- dera provided shelter for the Canary Island resistance, they were also considered a refuge during much of the aboriginal phase.Thus, some of the tors, highlands, crags and mountains not only played the role of a fortress against invaders, they were also offered asylum to those who broke the laws or rules established before colonial- ism, and as shelter and protection for their food against predators, shortages or plagues at that time.That is why we can talk about the mountains, not only as sacred places, but also as a refuge in the broad sense of the term.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And it is precisely their sacred nature that gave much</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of this zone, more specifically Tirma, an area that was</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">← <span class="s2">Figure 2.b.7.

This is recorded in the chronicles of the conquest, when they describe that “<span class="s3">that miscreant that had committed a crime was free and safe sheltered in those hills and he could not be brought out from there, keeping them and worshipping them as church- es and holy things</span>” (Morales Padrón, 1993).Thus, and ac- cording to some chroniclers, those who broke the rules or laws among the ancient Canary Island population, may have had the right to refuge or asylum in the sa- cred places, which in this case were the remote moun- tain spaces like Tirma, Amagro or Humiaga. The place name “Tirma” remains today as a district in the Tama- daba Highlands, set in the buffer zone of the proposed property. Based on the different sources and tales of the chronicles of the conquest, some authors, however, claim that Tirma was a larger, more general area, which largely coincides with the nominated property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">This refuge aspect can also be seen in some of the fea- tures of some of the troglodyte settlements, located on mountainous cliffs and in inaccessible areas, and in some of the elements that form part of them. Such is the case</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Figure 2.b.8.

These disputes could also have spread to farming produce. Protection, control and management of the produce could have been the mo- tive for building structures like the fortified grain stores, and for siting them in highly inaccessible and easily de- fendable places offered by the vertical walls of certain mountains.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.9.

In fact, the output must have been low in times of drought or poor harvests, which could well have caused tensions, as happened in the conflicts stemming from the control of grazing for their livestock (Abreu Galindo,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figura 2.b.10.

In fact, it appears that both functions fell to the <span class="s3">Faycan, </span>who was responsible for organising these religious ceremonies and rituals so closely related to controlling time or farming cycles and the prayers and rituals to propitiate the necessary rains (Abreu Galindo, 2009: 98).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">But perhaps the most significant aspect, or at least the one that has struck the deepest chord in the collective memory, as a symbolic reference point of the resistance of the communities of Gran Canaria to the conquest and colonisation by the Crown of Castile, was the role played by the complex terrain of the central part of the island, the sacred mountains that sustain the proposed property, as a fortress and refuge against the military penetration and siege by the troops of the Catholic Monarchs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Well into the war of conquest, which had started in 1478, its effects were plain to see: death, deportations, epidemics and famine, which led part of the island pop- ulation to surrender to the will of the invading troops. But another large part of the population decided to es- cape to the most rugged places of the island, where the deep gorges, the steep mountains and their inhabitants acted as fortresses to reorganise the final resistance to the enemy. Families with their livestock took refuge in the area of the Tejeda basin, sheltered by powerful crags like Bentayga, in their attempts to resist the Castilian military siege.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Nowadays, the most outstanding archaeological refer- ence in the area of the bid, to its character as a forti- fied refuge for resistance is Roque Bentayga. We have already described the archaeological evidence about</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">its religious and cultural aspects. This geological forma- tion rising from the centre of the Tejeda Caldera was one of the last refuges of the Canary Island resistance before they were conquered in 1483, as pointed out by the ethno-historical tales. Here is where they dug in and resisted the pounding of Pedro de Vera’s troops. The characteristics of this natural bulwark, with vertical walls around much of its perimeter, along with the con- struction of a defensive wall several metres high in the most vulnerable area, made Bentayga a difficult fortress to conquer. In the same way, the many dwelling caves to be found here and some that acted as granaries or silos, provided asylum to the people during these final episodes of the war of conquest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">But the two-week siege that Roque Bentayga suffered at the hands of the invading troops caused the island population to leave and flee towards another natural fortress nearby, known as Ajodar, whose location is un- known today (Morales Padrón, 1993:157). The shortage of water and food to feed families and livestock, despite the fact that they had granaries and a spring here, was</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">perhaps what triggered the flight towards even more rugged places within this complex terrain, where they could not keep up their resistance to the Castilian mili- tary machine, which finally conquered the island in 1483. But the mountainous area of the interior of the island kept its character as a refuge for customs to a certain extent, even after the conquest by the Catholic Mon- archs, a refuge for a form of relating with the environ- ment, of an identity that is reflected today in a cultural landscape where both material and non-material ele- ments with roots that go back to the aboriginal peoples of the island, still survive, customs and traditions that were kept away from any outside contact for over a thousand years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">N.B.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The quotes from the chroniclers of the Conquest are translated and adapted from old Castilian Spanish into English.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.11.View of the defensive wall or demarcation of the grounds that hold the almogaren (sanctuary) of Roque Bentayga.

The archaeoastronomical attributes of the Cultural Landscape, such as the sanctuaries and markers that show astronomical connections, described in Section 2.a.vii, are manifestations that are underpinned by this</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">ancient know-how and time-keeping system.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">One of the fundamental elements of a society is how its people were able to control and structure time, notably by creating a calendar. The aboriginal society of Gran Canaria was not exempt from this process, where the high mountain sanctuaries of the island played a signifi- cant role, as explained in other sections of this dossier. However, to better understand how this process was developed we must expand our analysis to a broader generic framework that encompasses the entire Canary Island archipelago.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Around the time of the of the Common Era, paleo- Berber people from Northwest Africa colonised the Canary Island Archipelago in a process that we still do not fully understand. In fact, we still do not know for certain whether they arrived on their own or they were brought to the islands, although the latter seems more credible. In the latter case, another problem would be when the settlers were taken there and by whom: by the Carthaginians, before the destruction of Carthage in 146 BC, or by the Romans and their allies some time later. Neither do we know whether the settlers all ar- rived together, or in several waves, or even whether each island was populated by a different tribe, which could be inferred from certain cultural aspects, or if the process was a progressive one, starting from the east- ernmost islands and moving west.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">A planned and perhaps forced colonisation process would support the idea of an arrival in a single wave</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">← <span class="s2">Figure 2.b.12.

(The case of the Bimbaches of El Hierro is more complicated.) Each had slightly different cultural characteristics, albeit with a certain collective varnish stemming from their common place of origin.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">What does seem certain, however, is that the new set- tlers brought with them many of the customs and tradi- tions of their land of origin. These traditions would, in all likelihood, include their traditions of worship, which, like their fellow Libyans of North Africa, focused mostly on worshiping the Sun, the Moon and the planets, as Antonio Tejera Gaspar (1992; 2001) showed by analys- ing the chronicles written in the centuries immediately before and after the conquest and colonisation of the archipelago by the Crown of Castile in the course of the 15<span class="s1">th </span>century.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">This importance of the Sun and the Moon is also ev- ident in their use as markers of time, another factor included in the chronicles and the first ethnohistorical sources. The sun and moon are the natural sources for the basic calculation of time. In its diurnal and annual movement, the Sun generates two basic cycles, a daily cycle and a yearly cycle. The latter can be structured by observing the annual offset of sunrise or sunset on the horizon, or by the shadow projected at the time of its meridian transit. It is characterised by the two solstices, the summer and the winter ones, and in some cases, the equinoxes. The solstices, as the name suggests, are mo- ments when the Sun stands still and changes direction on its annual voyage along the horizon. It is necessary to clarify the concept of “equinox” as this can have three different definitions, which can lead to distinct dates within the annual cycle.These would be:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: left;">1. The true astronomical Equinox, or the moment at which the Sun has 0° declination when crossing the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">celestial equator. This is a relatively abstract math- ematical definition and it requires a special concep- tion of the cosmos and a certain level of scientific knowledge, although it is not difficult to determine by relatively simple astronomical procedures, such as the fact that the shadow of the Sun on this day describes a straight line.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">2. The half-way point between the two solstices, also called the “megalithic” equinox, because it is seem- ingly characteristic of this cultural phenomenon.This is due to the unequal length of the seasons, such that the usual date of the current vernal equinox, March 21, does not match the temporal mid-point between 21<span class="s1">st </span>of December and June 21<span class="s1">st, </span>the usual dates of the two solstices. Determining this equi- nox requires counting a precise number of days and does not require elaborate astronomical observa- tions.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">3. The time at which the sun rises at the point of the horizon located halfway between the sunrise at the two solstices. This varies, depending upon the local topography, but is often confused with one of the previous two.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The Moon, thanks to its changing phases, generates an- other time cycle: the (synodic) month. In addition to the solar anf lunar cycles, there can often be a strong stellar component in how time is measured and struc- tured. Many societies, even today (Belmonte and Sanz de Lara, 2001), use the rising and setting of important stars or asterisms to organise time.

Chroniclers relate the importance of the equinoxes, and in particular the spring equinox, together with the solstices (mentioned implicitly by the Sun entering the sign of Cancer) as key moments of the annual cycle, both on Gran Canaria and perhaps on Fuerteventura:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">... and they say that they called the Majos, which were the spirits of their forefathers that roamed the seas , and</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">they say that they saw them in the form of small nuts on the sea shore, on the longest days of the year, when they organised grand festivities..., and they saw them at dawn on the day the sun was furthest away during the sign of Cancer <span class="p">(Gomes Escudero, h. 1520).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Indeed, abundant evidence of probable observations of the equinoxes and solstices has been found in ar- chaeological remains on several islands of the archi- pelago (Belmonte and Hoskin, 2002). These include the remarkable equinoctial markers found on the island of Gran Canaria (Esteban et al., 1996; 1997). Evidence has also been found of observations of the moon, and pos- sibly also of significant stars, such as the Pleiades and Sirius—presumably markers of time. One indisputable fact is that this measurement of time was carried out not only for profane, and practical, purposes such as harvesting the crops:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">… and by the fourth month, which was when they had fin- ished the harvest, which was in late June, they made grand festivities for nine days on end, ... <span class="p">(Attributed to Sedeño, c. 1505), in reference to Gran Canaria, and:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">but also for the holding of general gatherings:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">..When they made their august and collected the bread, held gatherings and festivities in each kingdom... <span class="p">(Espinosa 1590), referring to Tenerife;</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and also to indicate key moments of sacred time associ-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">ated with religion, moments that served both to hold great feasts:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">...they had their festivities like the Canarians either at the end of the era, or year starting in the moon of August named Beñasmer... <span class="p">(Marín de Cubas, 1694),</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">and to remember and worship their ancestors, as ex- plained in the case of Fuerteventura.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The sources are most explicit in the society of the an- cient Canarians and the Guanches, from Gran Canaria and Tenerife respectively, and this is where we can best interpret the archaeological and archaeoastronomical evidence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In the case of Tenerife, the sources, albeit limited, indicate the existence of a lunar calendar − or more probably of a vague lunisolar calendar − beginning with the August Moon, called “Beñesmer” or “Begnesmet” (a name with many different scholarly interpretations). This calendar was used for performing the most important civil and religious festivals, which is apparently reflected in the importance that it is currently given to the festivities of the Virgin of Candelaria, held in mid-August.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">However, how the cycle of 12 lunations of 354 days could be adjusted to the solar cycle remains completely unknown. On the one hand, the archaeoastronomical evidence points to the observation of the solstices, in particular the summer one, so that Begnesmet could be the “second” lunation, as some authors have suggested. On the other hand, anthropologist José Barrios (1997) has proposed that the observation of the heliacal rising of Canopus on dates around August 15th as the ideal reference point to start counting the moons. The little evidence we have does not allow us to be more precise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Gran Canaria on the other hand, is paradigmatic for the greater amount of information that has been collected, not only from an ethnohistorical perspective but also from an archaeological one. Several key moments in the annual cycle can be inferred from the chronicles - which have sometimes been interpreted as contradictory when they are not - and archaeological evidence:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">• The Spring Equinox, key moment to start counting the lunations.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">• The fourth month or lunation, counting from the Equinox, when the harvest festivals were performed. If the equinox is at the end of March, this would be</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the lunation whose first crescent would be visible</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">between late June and late July.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">• Summer solstice itself. This is after the next con- junction when the harvest festivities were held, in full agreement with the previous point. In reality, these are two different ways to express exactly the same idea.</p><p style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">• A key moment of the annual cycle of Sirius, the Dog star. (It makes sense that this should refer to the heliacal rising of the star, which occurred in mid-July at the time of the island’s colonisation, practically coinciding with the fourth month after the Equinox or the first month after the Solstice, possibly the sacred month of Aboriginal society.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Based on these premises and considering the archaeo- logical evidence, it is possible that the aboriginal society of Gran Canaria was governed by a simple cycle of three lunar years of 354 days (29½ x 12 lunar months). This cycle would be in line with the seasons with the addi- tion of one extra month every three years.This interca- lation would be calibrated by observing the vernal equi- nox, the summer solstice and, perhaps, the heliacal rising of the “Dog Star” (i.e. Sirius), the three key milestones mentioned in the Chronicles. It has been suggested that the central panel of the Cueva Pintada (“painted cave”) of Gáldar, one of the emblematic sites of this culture, was a schematic representation of this three-year cycle (see Figure 2.b.13; Belmonte and Hoskin, 2002),. A simi- lar luni-solar (or possibly luni-stellar) cycle could have been used on other islands of the archipelago, notably on the islands of Lanzarote and La Palma.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">An interesting question is how a proto-state society with unsophisticated technology knew about an abstract astronomical concept like the equinox. There are two possible answers to this. First, the chroniclers might have used the term “equinox” for a less precise aboriginal concept so that it would make sense to a European ear. However, the presence of equinoctial markers suggests otherwise. Alternatively, and perhaps more plausibly, the ancient Canarians might have brought that knowledge with them from their African homeland, where they could have obtained it from their contact with the Ro- mans, who indeed knew about the equinox and used it in their time-keeping system (especially the spring equi- nox, established on March 25th in the Julian reform of the calendar). Another possibility is that they obtained this knowledge from the Carthaginians, although this is more controversial because there is no guarantee that the Punics knew, or in any way used, this key date.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">This is an important point because if the ancient Canar- ians came to Gran Canaria with a calendar that was influenced by their contact with Rome, this could not have occurred before Carthage was taken by Scipio Emiliano in 146 BC, and this influence would suggest a late colonisation of the archipelago, around the year 0 A.D., when the Romans were well established in Africa Minor. This is also suggested by other clues such as, for example, the use of the Lybic-Berber script in the is- lands, as well as what is known as Lybic-Canary script, which clearly took its inspiration from Latin, albeit only in Lanzarote and Fuerteventura.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">There are, however, suggestions that the ancient Ca- narians might have followed a cycle of 8 or even 19 years, similar to the Octaeteris or to the Metonic cycle, respectively. It has been suggested that modest indica- tions of both can be found in the decoration of Cueva Pintada, but this is controversial.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">An important discovery, made almost by accident in 1998, seems to support the idea that a three-year luni- solar cycle was in use in the archipelago., A so-called washing-stone, found on the island of Lanzarote in 1998, was decorated with a series of stripes and other deco- rative motifs. The stone is now lost (possibly sold), but a series of photographs show clearly that this was an elaborate stele rather than a simple “washing-stone”. Judging from how it was made and its location, it was handmade and likely of Pre-Hispanic aboriginal origin. The decoration shows numerical patterns suggesting that this was a calendrical stele of some kind. On one side (the worst preserved because it had been used for centuries to scrub clothes), there are six lines of 7 (plus 7 or 8 additional ones that have disappeared), 7 (plus 7</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">or 8 more), 15, 14, 15, and 15 lines, respectively. These numbers could be astronomical and associated with the lunar count, which can be divided into two 14 or 15-day “fortnights”, depending on whether the lunation was 29 or 30 days.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">On the other side, originally hidden and hence much better preserved, there are eight lines of decoration, six with lines and two (the sixth and eighth) with small circles. The first three lines have 12 stripes each, which could represent a cycle of 3 years of 12 lunar months. The fourth and the fifth lines have 17 and 16, respec- tively; 17 + 16 is 33, which is the number of days that need to be added to three pure lunar years to obtain 3 solar year of 365 days [(354 x 3) + 33 = 365 x 3]. Line 7 has 36 stripes (12 x 3 again). Finally, the sixth and eighth</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">lines have 14 small circles each, totalling 28, the number of days in a sidereal month or the average number of days in which the moon is visible in each synodic month of 29 or 30 days. Therefore, on this second side of the stele, each figure seems to be related to counting the days of a 3-year lunisolar cycle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">While not conclusive, this evidence suggests that the stele functioned as a lunarsolar calendar covering one 3-year lunar cycle. In every third year the calendar would have been reset by observing some astronomical</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Figure 2.b.14.

It is extraordinarily-well preserved, and an analysis of its decorations by a multidisciplinary team of archae- ologists and astronomers suggests that these may have represented, albeit in a highly schematic and imprecise manner, a lunisolar calendar structured in cycles of three years, of 12, 12 and 13 lunations,.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Finally, we should mention two texts concerning the is- land of Tenerife which have given rise to an error in interpreting the calendars of this island and how time was structured. According to information provided by local poet Antonio de Viana, in 1604, the Guanches cel- ebrated festivals on the last nine days of April, which would have finished on the first of May:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">...but, by ancient custom, they kept the last nine days of the month of April as holidays, so that god would give them a prosperous harvest... <span class="p">(Viana, 1604).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">...It was that night, the last in April, solemn eve of delightful May and the end of the annual festivities and pleasures that the kings of the island held... <span class="p">(Viana, 1604).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">However, earlier chroniclers agreed that the August Moon was important. We believe that Viana could have had access to the text attributed to Sedeño, and, just as it has misled some modern researchers, he incorrectly interpreted the allusion to the fourth month as a refer- ence to the fourth month of the Gregorian calendar</p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">− i.e. the month of April − when obviously, the crops could not have been harvested. Viana applied informa- tion concerning the fourth lunation after the spring equinox on the island of Gran Canaria to the fourth month of his own calendar and hence to the ancient inhabitants of his island, the Guanches. Once again, this shows just how cautious one should be when trying to interpret both archaeological and ethno-historical sources in a modern light.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In summary, there is compelling, if not conclusive, evi- dence that the society that developed the nominated cultural landscape and skyscape of the highlands of Gran Canaria, also had an elaborate (although not especially sophisticated) lunisolar calendar that compelled ancient Canarians to constantly observe the sky from locations such as Risco Caído and Roque Bentayga.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">N.B.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The quotes from the chroniclers of the Conquest are translated and adapted from old Castilian Spanish into English.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">→ <span class="s2">Figure 2.b.15.

Observing indications or signs from the sky, as the people normally know them, and the behaviour of the stars associated with the area triggered a set of prognoses that determined the cycle of work. “The practises of predicting and divining that they engage in are intended to optimise the farming and livestock management of their resources” (Belmon- te, 1998:156). Farming and livestock in our Archipelago were the main subsistence resources of the people until the tourist boom arrived in the 1970s, which is why the custom of predicting the weather by observing the different phenomena that occur in nature was so deep- rooted in our Islands, particularly in the area of the nominated property, as we can see from the archaeoas- tronomical and ethnoastronomical research conducted to date. Moreover, the importance that the islanders put on these practises is evident from the meaning that some terms take on in the Canary Islands and the num- ber of sayings and proverbs relating to the weather and the climate. Words like “cabañuela” (weather forecast based on certain signs that appear on certain days of the year), take on a broader meaning in the Canary Is- lands than they do in Spanish in general, whereas other words like “cabañuelero” (a person who understands this practise) or “aberrunto” (for a hunch) is only used on some islands of the Archipelago.</p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Weather forecasts</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Lack of technological means and a prolonged observa- tion of different astronomical and climatic phenomena over time enabled the local inhabitants to make a set of short, medium and long-term forecasts. A year was good or bad, as they call it to indicate that it is going to be a year of drought, depending on the rains that fell. The astral indicator that was mainly used to know when it was going to rain was the planet Venus. According to the studies conducted (Belmonte and Sanz de Lara, 2001), Venus is the star that indicates rain, where 70% of the informants used in the study acknowledge that it brings rain. By the same token, all the participants in the study conducted in the nominated property refer to Ve- nus as the star that guided them in knowing whether or not it was going to rain. Normally it is the first celestial body that they name when asked if they use the sky to forecast the weather. If we compare the data obtained by Belmonte and Sanz de Lara (2001) in relation to Venus on other islands of the Archipelago with the data from our study however, we can see a significant dif- ference. Informants from Tenerife, Fuerteventura and La Gomera interviewed by these scholars described the path of Venus based on the points of the compass. But in the area of the cultural landscape, interviewees observe the path of the star using the mountains, deviations from the horizon and the territory as geographical markers of the skyscape. Thus, a local from Coruña claimed that “<span class="s3">when Venus set over La Degollada de la Laja, it meant rain, you could feel rain on its way […] and when the star was lost on La Degollada de la Laja, when you couldn’t see it, winter was coming to an end</span>”.They also said that “<span class="s3">when it moved from La Degollada la Laja to Bocabarranco, sum- mer is on its way, but when it moved from Bocabarranco to La Degollada de la Laja, winter is coming</span>”. In this case, the path of Venus does not just mark the rainy season, it also indicates the beginning and the end of summer and winter. This path is the best known by local informants. However, some provide other territorial references. A local resident of Chajunco points out that when Venus reached Tres Cruces “<span class="s3">it meant rain would fall</span>”. On the other hand, an informant from Las Cuevas told us that</p></body></html>
